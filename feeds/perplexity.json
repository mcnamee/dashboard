The research, published December 18 in Science Advances, offers potential applications from medical imaging to fusion energy[1][2][3].\n\nLed by Dr. Harold Ruiz from Leicester's School of Engineering, the team developed a physics-informed optimization framework that solves Maxwell's equations to design magnetic cloaks for arbitrarily shaped structures[1][2]. Previous magnetic cloaking demonstrations were restricted to simple cylinders or spheres, limiting real-world applicability[1][2][3].\n\nThe devices work by manipulating magnetic field lines to flow around objects as if they weren't there, making the cloaked object magnetically invisible while leaving surrounding fields undisturbed[2][3]. The design combines two materials with opposing magnetic properties: an inner superconducting layer that repels magnetic fields and an outer soft ferromagnetic layer that attracts them, creating a balanced effect that eliminates field distortion[1][2][3].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/345c396e-cc04-419d-b426-656c222b5176.mp3","url":"leicester-engineers-develop-pr-VzHglSLWQhqaU7XIQNL9sQ","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/6e9020d6-e059-4c99-8a24-764a4bcd0c57","published_datetime":"2025-12-19T20:18:40.886390","title":"AI stocks surge as Micron earnings fuel sector rally","featured_image":{"url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-stock-soars-on-earnings-beat-amid-unprecedented-ai-fueled-demand-for-memory-chips-164848986.html","name":"Micron stock soars on earnings beat amid 'unprecedented' AI-fueled demand for memory chips","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--4U7qdLVI--/t_limit/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cdgd21cdq5P9JRtDXS.s8A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/48d41b80-9583-11f0-85f5-51d7abc2a309","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--10aBd6aL--/t_thumbnail/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cdgd21cdq5P9JRtDXS.s8A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/48d41b80-9583-11f0-85f5-51d7abc2a309"},"description":"Artificial intelligence stocks surged Friday, driving major indexes higher and signaling renewed investor confidence in a sector that has weathered concerns over valuations and returns in recent weeks.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed approximately 1.2%, extending Thursday's 1.4% gain[1][2][3], while the S&P 500 rose 0.8%[3][4].

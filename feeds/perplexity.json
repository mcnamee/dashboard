Since the EU's petroleum products ban took effect in February 2023 through early 2024, Europe imported €3.1 billion worth of oil products from three Turkish ports with no refining facilities, while 86% of those ports' imports came from Russia during the same period, according to research by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air[2][4][3].\n\nThe findings underscore the challenge Europe faces in severing energy ties with Moscow despite ambitious targets. On December 3, EU lawmakers reached a deal to ban all Russian gas imports by autumn 2027, marking what European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called \"the dawn of a new era, the era of Europe's full energy independence from Russia\"[5][6][7][8].

The findings suggest that bipedalism — a defining feature of the human lineage — emerged far earlier than many scientists previously believed.\n\nThe study, led by Scott Williams, an associate professor at New York University, reexamined limb bones from *Sahelanthropus tchadensis*, a species discovered in Chad's Djurab Desert in the early 2000s. Using high-resolution 3D analysis, Williams and his team identified a small projection on the thigh bone called a femoral tubercle, which serves as the attachment point for the iliofemoral ligament[1][2][3]. Until now, this feature had been documented only in bipedal hominins.\n\n\"Our analysis of these fossils offers direct evidence that *Sahelanthropus tchadensis* could walk on two legs, demonstrating that bipedalism evolved early in our lineage and from an ancestor that looked most similar to today's chimpanzees and bonobos,\" Williams said[1][4].","audio_url":"","url":"sahelanthropus-fossil-shows-ea-GCA3bzPpTeG76SZIr1oNfg","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/456097a2-3054-433a-a7ea-96b6365c9b33","published_datetime":"2026-01-02T18:31:22.052232","title":"Fountain candles on champagne bottles started Swiss fire that killed 40, prosecutor says","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/europe/switzerland-fire-crans-montana-ski-resort-bar-explosion-latest-news-b2893326.html","name":"Switzerland fire latest: Sparkler candles on champagne bottles revealed as likely cause of deadly blaze","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--DnL4ZwOe--/t_limit/https://static.the-independent.com/2026/01/01/12/54/TOPSHOT-SWITZERLAND-ACCIDENT-EXPLOSION-TOURISM-POLICE-phbl8137.jpeg%3Ftrim%3D0%252C0%252C0%252C0%26width%3D1200%26height%3D800%26crop%3D1200%253A800","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--x6Nb-Pih--/t_thumbnail/https://static.the-independent.com/2026/01/01/12/54/TOPSHOT-SWITZERLAND-ACCIDENT-EXPLOSION-TOURISM-POLICE-phbl8137.jpeg%3Ftrim%3D0%252C0%252C0%252C0%26width%3D1200%26height%3D800%26crop%3D1200%253A800"},"description":"Swiss authorities announced Friday that fountain candles attached to champagne bottles likely ignited the devastating New Year's Eve fire that killed 40 people and injured more than 100 at a ski resort bar in Crans-Montana[1][2][3].

Skywatchers in the Northern Hemisphere are witnessing the Quadrantid meteor shower, coinciding with January's full Wolf supermoon, as space agencies worldwide prepare for historic lunar and planetary missions.\n\nThe Quadrantid meteor shower reached its peak between Friday, January 2, and Saturday, January 3, according to the American Meteor Society[1][2][3]. Under ideal conditions, the shower typically produces around 25 meteors per hour, with some years seeing up to 120 meteors per hour[1][4]. However, this year's viewing conditions are far from ideal. The full Wolf supermoon, which officially reached peak illumination at 5:03 a.m. EST on January 3, has washed out all but the brightest streaking meteors[5][6][7]. \"The biggest enemy of enjoying a meteor shower is the full moon,\" Mike Shanahan, planetarium director at Liberty Science Center, told the Associated Press[8].\n\nThe Quadrantids are unusual among meteor showers because they originate from an asteroid rather than a comet. Astronomers traced the shower's source to asteroid 2003 EH1, which orbits the sun every 5.5 years[9][3]. The shower is named after Quadrans Muralis, a constellation identified in 1795 that was later removed from the official list in 1922[9][10].","audio_url":"","url":"major-space-events-and-meteor-lytg1F3GSBCuuGPlZrux_w","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/bc2b0f22-5792-4c0f-8501-b98ff245d5c3","published_datetime":"2026-01-02T17:00:16.582683","title":"Hubble captures glowing gas plume from distant galaxy","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.gadgets360.com/science/news/hubble-captures-gas-escaping-sideways-spiral-galaxy-ngc-4388-in-virgo-cluster-9855412","name":"Hubble Captures Gas Escaping Sideways Spiral Galaxy NGC 4388 ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--seqm0dzL--/t_limit/https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/Galactic_Gas_full_1_1766242164724.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--lW-tCN6u--/t_thumbnail/https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/Galactic_Gas_full_1_1766242164724.jpg"},"description":"NASA's space telescopes have captured extraordinary views of previously unseen cosmic events in recent weeks, providing scientists with fresh insights into galactic evolution and exotic planetary systems.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope on January 1 released new imagery of NGC 4388, a spiral galaxy 60 million light-years away in the Virgo constellation, revealing a luminous plume of gas streaming from the galaxy's nucleus[1]. The phenomenon, invisible in previous Hubble observations from 2016, occurs as NGC 4388 plunges through the intracluster medium—hot wisps of gas occupying the space between galaxies in the Virgo cluster[1][2].\n\nAs the galaxy moves through this medium, pressure from the hot gas strips material from NGC 4388's disk, causing it to trail behind in a glowing tail[1]. Researchers suspect a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center provides some of the ionizing energy that causes the gas cloud to glow, while shock waves may be responsible for ionizing filaments farther out[1][3].","audio_url":"","url":"hubble-and-webb-reveal-new-cos-MCKYrjDuTc6DEXmOALksJw","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/473abbfb-ac80-477e-bfeb-fad9383f3fa4","published_datetime":"2026-01-02T16:56:54.012106","title":"Maduro offers US talks on drugs, oil after CIA strike","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/maduro-says-venezuela-ready-make-deal-us-drugs-oil-after-military-strikes","name":"Maduro says Venezuela is 'ready' to make deal with US on drugs and oil after military strikes","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--lqjSHffL--/t_limit/https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/12/maduro_carcas_meeting.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--iMlIjWoS--/t_thumbnail/https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/12/maduro_carcas_meeting.jpg"},"description":"Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro signaled openness to negotiate with the United States on drug trafficking and oil investments in an interview aired January 1, marking a diplomatic overture amid escalating tensions following the first known U.S. strike on Venezuelan territory[1][2][3].\n\nIn a pre-recorded interview with Spanish journalist Ignacio Ramonet broadcast on state television, Maduro said Venezuela is \"ready\" to discuss a drug-trafficking deal with Washington \"whenever they want it, wherever they want it and however they want it\"[4][5][1][3].

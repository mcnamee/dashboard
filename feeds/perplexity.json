Skywatchers in the Northern Hemisphere are witnessing the Quadrantid meteor shower, coinciding with January's full Wolf supermoon, as space agencies worldwide prepare for historic lunar and planetary missions.\n\nThe Quadrantid meteor shower reached its peak between Friday, January 2, and Saturday, January 3, according to the American Meteor Society[1][2][3]. Under ideal conditions, the shower typically produces around 25 meteors per hour, with some years seeing up to 120 meteors per hour[1][4]. However, this year's viewing conditions are far from ideal. The full Wolf supermoon, which officially reached peak illumination at 5:03 a.m. EST on January 3, has washed out all but the brightest streaking meteors[5][6][7]. \"The biggest enemy of enjoying a meteor shower is the full moon,\" Mike Shanahan, planetarium director at Liberty Science Center, told the Associated Press[8].\n\nThe Quadrantids are unusual among meteor showers because they originate from an asteroid rather than a comet. Astronomers traced the shower's source to asteroid 2003 EH1, which orbits the sun every 5.5 years[9][3]. The shower is named after Quadrans Muralis, a constellation identified in 1795 that was later removed from the official list in 1922[9][10].","audio_url":"","url":"major-space-events-and-meteor-lytg1F3GSBCuuGPlZrux_w","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/bc2b0f22-5792-4c0f-8501-b98ff245d5c3","published_datetime":"2026-01-02T17:00:16.582683","title":"Hubble captures glowing gas plume from distant galaxy","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.gadgets360.com/science/news/hubble-captures-gas-escaping-sideways-spiral-galaxy-ngc-4388-in-virgo-cluster-9855412","name":"Hubble Captures Gas Escaping Sideways Spiral Galaxy NGC 4388 ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--seqm0dzL--/t_limit/https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/Galactic_Gas_full_1_1766242164724.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--lW-tCN6u--/t_thumbnail/https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/Galactic_Gas_full_1_1766242164724.jpg"},"description":"NASA's space telescopes have captured extraordinary views of previously unseen cosmic events in recent weeks, providing scientists with fresh insights into galactic evolution and exotic planetary systems.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope on January 1 released new imagery of NGC 4388, a spiral galaxy 60 million light-years away in the Virgo constellation, revealing a luminous plume of gas streaming from the galaxy's nucleus[1]. The phenomenon, invisible in previous Hubble observations from 2016, occurs as NGC 4388 plunges through the intracluster medium—hot wisps of gas occupying the space between galaxies in the Virgo cluster[1][2].\n\nAs the galaxy moves through this medium, pressure from the hot gas strips material from NGC 4388's disk, causing it to trail behind in a glowing tail[1]. Researchers suspect a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center provides some of the ionizing energy that causes the gas cloud to glow, while shock waves may be responsible for ionizing filaments farther out[1][3].","audio_url":"","url":"hubble-and-webb-reveal-new-cos-MCKYrjDuTc6DEXmOALksJw","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/473abbfb-ac80-477e-bfeb-fad9383f3fa4","published_datetime":"2026-01-02T16:56:54.012106","title":"Maduro offers US talks on drugs, oil after CIA strike","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/maduro-says-venezuela-ready-make-deal-us-drugs-oil-after-military-strikes","name":"Maduro says Venezuela is 'ready' to make deal with US on drugs and oil after military strikes","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--lqjSHffL--/t_limit/https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/12/maduro_carcas_meeting.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--iMlIjWoS--/t_thumbnail/https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/12/maduro_carcas_meeting.jpg"},"description":"Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro signaled openness to negotiate with the United States on drug trafficking and oil investments in an interview aired January 1, marking a diplomatic overture amid escalating tensions following the first known U.S. strike on Venezuelan territory[1][2][3].\n\nIn a pre-recorded interview with Spanish journalist Ignacio Ramonet broadcast on state television, Maduro said Venezuela is \"ready\" to discuss a drug-trafficking deal with Washington \"whenever they want it, wherever they want it and however they want it\"[4][5][1][3].

By analyzing data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Chinese LAMOST telescope, and the European Space Agency's Gaia satellite, researchers sifted through more than 135,000 candidate stars before identifying the most reliable hypervelocity examples[1][3].\n\nSeven of the discovered stars are moving at tangential velocities exceeding 800 kilometers per second—well above the roughly 550 km/s needed to break free from the Milky Way at the sun's position[1][3][5]. According to Phys.org, all 87 stars exceed the galaxy's escape velocity in their tangential component, suggesting many will eventually drift into intergalactic space[1][2].","audio_url":"","url":"astronomers-use-runaway-stars-r8jqTSbrQ7yPZLGSUPH5Vw","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/a609d25b-1562-48b7-8160-89d9f8aa2624","published_datetime":"2026-01-02T10:28:02.658915","title":"Scientists create self-powered quantum maser with stable microwave signals","featured_image":{"url":"https://phys.org/news/2025-12-quantum-technology-lab-life-widespread.html","name":"Quantum technology moves from lab to life, but widespread use ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--2TfGFOnF--/t_limit/https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/when-will-quantum-tech.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--qfuREws5--/t_thumbnail/https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/when-will-quantum-tech.jpg"},"description":"Scientists at TU Wien and the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology have demonstrated the first self-induced superradiant quantum maser, a discovery that could reshape precision technologies from GPS navigation to medical imaging.\n\nPublished in Nature Physics, the research shows how quantum particles can spontaneously cooperate to generate stable, long-lived microwave signals without external power, overturning previous assumptions about how quantum systems behave[1][2][3]. The team coupled nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond—tiny atomic defects containing electron spins—to a microwave cavity, where they observed an unexpected phenomenon: after an initial burst of energy, the system produced a sustained train of coherent microwave pulses lasting up to a millisecond[2][4].\n\n\"What's remarkable is that the seemingly messy interactions between spins actually fuel the emission,\" said Dr. Wenzel Kersten, first author of the study, in a press statement. \"The system organizes itself, producing an extremely coherent microwave signal from the very disorder that usually destroys it\"[1][3].","audio_url":"","url":"researchers-achieve-first-self-60RiJS.UT0WWCstx3c7Y1g","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/f16e2c9e-b813-45aa-9728-6d2c262c5a6d","published_datetime":"2026-01-02T09:42:48.959692","title":"Eurozone manufacturing hits nine-month low on German decline","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/german-manufacturing-sector-faces-sharp-decline-new-orders-pmi-shows-2025-12-01/","name":"German manufacturing sector faces sharp decline in new orders, PMI shows","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--vHfECbJu--/t_limit/https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7SQ3SDEMGJMHBKJIPBMGL6NL7Y.jpg%3Fauth%3D824a11aaa68e552651fe75f59a6d1b583b9bb74f5656352fbb058022d154238c%26height%3D1005%26width%3D1920%26quality%3D80%26smart%3Dtrue","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--RUr8QMy6--/t_thumbnail/https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7SQ3SDEMGJMHBKJIPBMGL6NL7Y.jpg%3Fauth%3D824a11aaa68e552651fe75f59a6d1b583b9bb74f5656352fbb058022d154238c%26height%3D1005%26width%3D1920%26quality%3D80%26smart%3Dtrue"},"description":"The eurozone's manufacturing sector closed 2025 on a downbeat note, with activity contracting at the sharpest pace in nine months as Germany's industrial woes spread across the currency bloc, according to final data released Friday.\n\nThe HCOB Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by S&P Global, fell to 48.8 in December from 49.6 in November, marking the deepest contraction since March and signaling deteriorating factory conditions across the region[1][2][3].

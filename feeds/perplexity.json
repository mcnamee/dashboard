The comet remained effectively invisible in those earlier recordings until scientists revisited the data with updated parameters and image-stacking techniques, coadding more than 9,000 individual frames to reconstruct a faint but consistent signal matching the object's trajectory.[1][2][3]","audio_url":"","url":"nasa-finds-3iatlas-in-old-data-Wrp.JtSeQlSpXrUw6mPz3w","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/7e1d6a5c-6c53-433c-87a2-48306bc4969b","published_datetime":"2026-01-31T10:35:29.728304","title":"Scientists engineer bacteria to produce molecules using light","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.synbiobeta.com/read/light-driven-method-boosts-eco-friendly-biomanufacturing-with-novel-enzyme-reactions","name":"Light-Driven Method Boosts Eco-Friendly Biomanufacturing with ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--NTyb-1it--/t_limit/https://framerusercontent.com/images/wGSfTeDElO8jJ8EAvBjRAU2Vi0.jpg%3Fwidth%3D1920%26height%3D1080","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--YjfCOZQl--/t_thumbnail/https://framerusercontent.com/images/wGSfTeDElO8jJ8EAvBjRAU2Vi0.jpg%3Fwidth%3D1920%26height%3D1080"},"description":"Researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have engineered bacteria that can manufacture novel molecules when activated by light, marking what scientists describe as the first integration of light-driven enzymatic reactions into cellular metabolism.

The findings arrive just days before a rare celestial alignment on January 22 that could provide unprecedented data about this cosmic traveler from beyond our solar system.\n\nThe study, which analyzed Hubble Space Telescope images from late 2025, used two independent methods to determine the rotation period: tracking the wobble of the comet's jet-like features and measuring brightness variations over time. The jet position angle analysis yielded a period of 7.20 ± 0.05 hours, while photometric measurements produced 7.136 ± 0.001 hours.[1][2][3]","audio_url":"","url":"3iatlas-interstellar-object-ro-xOgCoCYuS.2wVj2cJkHhGQ","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/47448f2a-4d08-4080-8230-019300de362b","published_datetime":"2026-01-16T11:57:23.737408","title":"China's giant telescope captures first clear evidence of fast radio burst origins","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202303/1286812.shtml","name":"China's FAST telescope discovered over 740 new pulsars ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--D7rNspoh--/t_limit/https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-08-01/5e357d6b-91fc-4306-aba0-d5d7fd55f097.jpeg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--ZQN8V7VU--/t_thumbnail/https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-08-01/5e357d6b-91fc-4306-aba0-d5d7fd55f097.jpeg"},"description":"Using the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, an international team of researchers has captured the first clear evidence linking mysterious cosmic radio signals to a dense plasma cloud, providing strong support for the theory that some fast radio bursts originate from binary star systems.\n\nThe findings, published Friday in the journal Science, are based on nearly 20 months of observations by China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, known as FAST, of a repeating fast radio burst designated FRB 20220529, located approximately 2.9 billion light-years from Earth.[1][2][3]","audio_url":"","url":"china-telescope-reveals-cause-GCUr10_oS_uexolz3_zOrA","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/8854cab9-4b7b-414f-a42d-f0d13052b33a","published_datetime":"2026-01-16T11:24:01.107534","title":"Astronomers discover massive iron bar hiding inside Ring Nebula","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/04/world/webb-telescope-ring-nebula-scn","name":"Webb telescope captures stunning new look at the Ring Nebula ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--B7N2Age_--/t_limit/https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230804122801-james-webb-space-telescope-ring-nebula.jpg%3Fc%3Doriginal","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--CwBqHdiH--/t_thumbnail/https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230804122801-james-webb-space-telescope-ring-nebula.jpg%3Fc%3Doriginal"},"description":"A European team has discovered a hidden bar of iron stretching across the interior of the Ring Nebula, one of the most iconic objects in the night sky.

The findings, published in Nature Astronomy on January 7, could improve space weather forecasting and enhance understanding of how solar flares unleash their extreme energy[1][2][3].\n\nThe discovery pinpoints a newly identified class of high-energy particles in the solar corona—the sun's upper atmosphere—as the origin of gamma-ray signals observed during major solar flare events. These particles, measured at energies of several million electron volts, are hundreds to thousands of times more energetic than typical flare particles and move near the speed of light[1][2][3].","audio_url":"","url":"njit-scientists-identify-hidde-msg.ik4ZR9a8Yopzxy0dQA","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/42d2cbf5-67bf-4d62-ac87-de52726c597c","published_datetime":"2026-01-08T08:09:36.967854","title":"Australian drill extracts first deep Antarctic ice core","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.antarctica.gov.au/science/climate-processes-and-change/antarctic-palaeoclimate/million-year-ice-core/","name":"Million year ice core – Australian Antarctic Program","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--emHzZufP--/t_limit/https://www.antarctica.gov.au/site/assets/files/54688/2025-01-14_derry_removes_core_from_barrel_with_etienne_loosening_chips_jackmcleod.1200x0.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--qKSl3aTn--/t_thumbnail/https://www.antarctica.gov.au/site/assets/files/54688/2025-01-14_derry_removes_core_from_barrel_with_etienne_loosening_chips_jackmcleod.1200x0.jpg"},"description":"A custom-built Australian drill has successfully extracted its first deep ice core from Antarctica, marking a pivotal milestone in a project to unlock climate secrets dating back more than one million years.

Five years ago, a catastrophic drought turned his fertile land to dust, killing thousands of native kangaroos and forcing him to reconsider the future of his century-old family farm. Today, those same fields host part of the massive MacIntyre Wind Farm, generating power for 700,000 homes—and providing Finlay with crucial supplemental income as agriculture grows increasingly unpredictable[1][2].\n\nHis story reflects a broader economic shift gaining momentum worldwide. As renewable energy costs continue their precipitous decline, a rapid transition away from fossil fuels has emerged as not just an environmental imperative, but an enormous economic opportunity. According to a University of Oxford study, transitioning to renewable energy by 2050 could save the global economy at least $12 trillion in energy system costs compared to maintaining current fossil fuel use[3][4][5].","audio_url":"","url":"clean-energy-shift-could-save-NR679qq2Skuq9WL4KOuJXg","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/56c7df57-f592-4444-99a5-8fc1a5695d82","published_datetime":"2026-01-08T01:06:41.305949","title":"Trump admin weighs military option for Greenland purchase","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/07/nx-s1-5670244/trump-greenland","name":"White House says 'all options' on the table for Greenland - NPR","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--mpoQsa3k--/t_limit/https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8640x4860%2B0%2B450/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fff%252F73%252Fa326640b4643b0bebb46d53e4c1b%252Fap26007350267999.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--A4RzQWQb--/t_thumbnail/https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8640x4860%2B0%2B450/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fff%252F73%252Fa326640b4643b0bebb46d53e4c1b%252Fap26007350267999.jpg"},"description":"President Donald Trump's administration is actively discussing the acquisition of Greenland from Denmark, with White House officials confirming that military action remains on the table despite diplomatic efforts taking priority[1][2][3].

Chipmakers Nvidia, AMD, and Intel unveiled next-generation processors designed to power this shift, while robot manufacturers demonstrated machines that can finally tackle one of home automation's last frontiers: climbing stairs.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang kicked off the show by announcing the Vera Rubin platform, a next-generation AI superchip architecture now in full production that the company claims offers more than triple the speed of its current Blackwell chips[1][2]. The platform, named after astronomer Vera Rubin, combines six chips into what Nvidia calls \"one AI supercomputer,\" with products expected to roll out from partners in the second half of 2026[2][3].\n\n\"The moment for physical AI has arrived—when machines start to comprehend, reason, and operate in the real world,\" Huang said during his keynote[4]. He also unveiled Alpamayo, an AI model for autonomous vehicles that uses vision-language-action models to handle unfamiliar driving scenarios[2][5]. Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius reported testing the Nvidia-powered system on public roads, driving for more than an hour through heavy traffic, with the vehicles expected to launch in the first quarter of 2026[2].\n\nAMD CEO Lisa Su showcased the company's Ryzen AI 400 series processors for PCs, claiming 1.3 times faster multitasking and 1.7 times quicker content creation compared to competitors[6][7]. The company also detailed its forthcoming MI500 series data center GPUs, asserting they will deliver up to a 1,000-fold enhancement in AI performance compared to the MI300X GPUs[7]. Intel announced its Panther Lake processors, branded as Core Ultra Series 3, featuring up to 180 platform TOPS (trillions of operations per second) for AI acceleration and claiming more than 50% faster CPU and graphics performance versus the previous generation[8]","audio_url":"","url":"ai-and-robotics-dominate-ces-2-2KxChDY0QNylWFkNsPdcnw","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/21f7370c-398b-4f0f-baef-948eadeb50ec","published_datetime":"2026-01-06T21:22:35.367651","title":"Europa may lack energy to support life, study says","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.space.com/15498-europa-sdcmp.html","name":"Europa: A guide to Jupiter's icy moon | Space","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--fjnr90EO--/t_limit/https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sAY6F2ycuhXAfU39JVcrHF-1920-80.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--uK2UXhW0--/t_thumbnail/https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sAY6F2ycuhXAfU39JVcrHF-1920-80.jpg"},"description":"A new study published this week suggests that Jupiter's moon Europa—long considered one of the most promising places to search for extraterrestrial life—may lack the underwater geological activity necessary to sustain organisms in its vast subsurface ocean[1][2][3][4].\n\nResearchers led by Paul Byrne, an associate professor of Earth, environmental, and planetary sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, calculated that Europa's seafloor is likely too quiet to support life today[2][3][5].

However, at least one in five systems degrade at least 1.5 times faster than this typical rate, and roughly one in 12 degrade twice as fast.\"\n\nFor operators of solar farms where hundreds of thousands of panels are installed, the findings represent a hidden financial risk that challenges the economic models underpinning the industry's growth[1][2][3].","audio_url":"","url":"unsw-study-finds-20-percent-of-n5ni8eJ0T8uzqEg5PEng1Q","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/abe3b6a4-92a5-4877-87c4-90dd5487c3d1","published_datetime":"2026-01-06T15:27:06.857293","title":"Nvidia AI boom drives laptop prices up 15-20%","featured_image":{"url":"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-ceo-ai-breakthrough-completely-113042227.html","name":"Nvidia CEO: This AI 'breakthrough' is 'completely genius'","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--O-_W4ZpU--/t_limit/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cZ.A2i8c94ZsFbUfOpDN6w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/b3e6e620-ea81-11f0-bffe-5b3879265f0c","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--eWmub_YE--/t_thumbnail/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cZ.A2i8c94ZsFbUfOpDN6w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/b3e6e620-ea81-11f0-bffe-5b3879265f0c"},"description":"Nvidia unveiled its most powerful AI computing platform yet at CES 2026 on Monday, even as the chip giant's insatiable demand for memory components drives laptop prices to unprecedented heights, leaving consumers caught in the crossfire of the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe company's Rubin platform, announced by CEO Jensen Huang in Las Vegas, promises five times the AI performance of its predecessor while slashing computing costs[1][2][3][4].

But a new strand of physics research is reviving an old, unsettling possibility: **time may not be fundamental at all**, and what humans experience as “flow” could instead be a byproduct of how the universe stores and spreads information.\n\nIn an essay published January 28, physicist Florian Neukart of Leiden University argued that modern physics still lacks a unified account of time, in part because its two pillars treat it differently: **Einstein’s relativity** folds time into spacetime, while **quantum mechanics** typically assumes time as an external parameter. Attempts to combine the two, he wrote, can even yield equations in which time “disappears,” a long-running difficulty known as the “problem of time”.[1][2][3]","audio_url":"","url":"physicists-question-whether-ti-KmFzvPmPTsKznw5NtcFpew","partition_name":"partition1"}]}

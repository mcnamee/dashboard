The technology, published in Nature Communications last month, eliminates decades-old constraints that have limited optical imaging[1][2][3].\n\nThe Multiscale Aperture Synthesis Imager (MASI) resolves features as small as 780 nanometers from two centimeters away—a combination previously impossible with conventional optical systems[1][3]. According to UConn Today, traditional microscopes typically require working distances of less than one millimeter to achieve comparable resolution[2].","audio_url":"","url":"uconn-unveils-lensless-imaging-Wa4vD_zKQiySK7LRAg3OEA","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/36c5117b-baff-45ae-b6c8-a1470b5c1261","published_datetime":"2025-12-24T07:27:14.246284","title":"BP sells 65% of Castrol to Stonepeak for $6B","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/devils-details-why-bps-debt-may-deter-buyer-2025-06-25/","name":"Devil's in the details: Why BP's debt may deter a buyer | Reuters","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--NSx5DoiJ--/t_limit/https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IPXNWFHVMZO5FMENQDNXY22ZUQ.jpg%3Fauth%3D0a24de2fc14e56991f1212a951961547c676aae5395dd7c94260b96f3677e2e0%26height%3D1005%26width%3D1920%26quality%3D80%26smart%3Dtrue","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--lL5SsQzC--/t_thumbnail/https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IPXNWFHVMZO5FMENQDNXY22ZUQ.jpg%3Fauth%3D0a24de2fc14e56991f1212a951961547c676aae5395dd7c94260b96f3677e2e0%26height%3D1005%26width%3D1920%26quality%3D80%26smart%3Dtrue"},"description":"BP agreed to sell a 65 percent stake in its Castrol lubricants business to investment firm Stonepeak in a deal valuing the unit at $10.1 billion, the company announced on December 24, marking one of the oil giant's largest asset sales as it seeks to reduce debt and refocus on core operations[1][2][3].\n\nThe British energy company will receive approximately $6 billion in proceeds from the transaction, which includes about $800 million for the prepayment of future dividend income on its retained 35 percent stake[2].

According to the International Telecommunication Union, 6G will introduce new usage scenarios including \"integrated artificial intelligence and communication\" and \"ubiquitous connectivity\"[1][2]. However, ensuring continuous AI services in remote and underserved areas remains difficult with ground-based infrastructure alone.\n\nThe space-ground fluid AI framework draws its name from water's ability to flow seamlessly across boundaries. AI model parameters and data features move continuously between satellites and ground stations, adapting to the ever-changing network topology created by satellite mobility[2][3]. Professor Kaibin Huang, a key researcher on the project, noted the framework leverages satellites' predictable trajectories to enable fluid horizontal and vertical task migration across networks[4][3].","audio_url":"","url":"researchers-propose-satellites-yDXxd3yyT3.HUQWMkPGMhg","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/24256a1a-bcb7-4d19-a8f8-0be875183426","published_datetime":"2025-12-24T00:28:58.301331","title":"MIT develops single-pull string method for instant 3D deployable structures","featured_image":{"url":"https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/single-string-flat-to-3d-structures","name":"Single string pull enables rapid assembly of futuristic 3D ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s---cJSEUQo--/t_limit/https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-2025-12-24T050226.927.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--jmcQeP_o--/t_thumbnail/https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-2025-12-24T050226.927.jpg"},"description":"Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a technique that transforms flat panels into complex three-dimensional structures with a single pull of a string, potentially enabling rapid deployment of emergency shelters, medical facilities, and space habitats.\n\nThe method, presented December 17 at the Association for Computing Machinery's SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 conference in Hong Kong and announced by MIT on December 22, converts user-designed 3D structures into interconnected flat tiles that deploy smoothly with minimal friction[1][2][3].

The Freya Hydrate Mounds, published this week in Nature Communications, extend the known depth limit for such formations by nearly 1,800 meters[1][2][3][4].\n\nThe discovery was made during the Ocean Census Arctic Deep–EXTREME24 expedition in May 2024 on the Molloy Ridge, using the remotely operated vehicle Aurora to explore the seafloor beneath massive methane gas plumes[2][3][4]. Scientists from UiT - The Arctic University of Norway led the expedition, documenting three hydrate mounds, collapse features, and dense communities of chemosynthetic organisms that survive without sunlight[1][5][2].\n\n\"This discovery rewrites the playbook for Arctic deep-sea ecosystems and carbon cycling,\" said Giuliana Panieri, professor at UiT and Chief Scientist of the expedition. \"We found an ultra-deep system that is both geologically dynamic and biologically rich, with implications for biodiversity, climate processes, and future stewardship of the High North\"[2][3].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/d16d0a76-b969-4272-b42f-847778ce1263.mp3","url":"scientists-discover-deepest-ga-.7W7fHl8QKiuwEBLPbSmfg","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/bcaedc34-5a62-4cf1-b623-df275600116f","published_datetime":"2025-12-23T15:01:45.848512","title":"Scientists map 140,000 DNA loops in most detailed 3D genome atlas","featured_image":{"url":"https://cen.acs.org/biological-chemistry/dna/Spatial-3D-map-human-genome/103/web/2025/12","name":"Spatial 3D map of the human genome is built","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--7g5vRDb1--/t_limit/https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/291000-loops%3F%24responsive%24%26qlt%3D90%2C0%26resMode%3Dsharp2%26fmt%3Dwebp","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--sOAtzR_G--/t_thumbnail/https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/291000-loops%3F%24responsive%24%26qlt%3D90%2C0%26resMode%3Dsharp2%26fmt%3Dwebp"},"description":"Researchers have created the most comprehensive three-dimensional maps of the human genome to date, cataloging more than 140,000 DNA loops that reveal how chromosomes fold and organize themselves within cell nuclei, according to a study published in Nature[1][2][3].\n\nThe landmark research, led by investigators at Northwestern University and the 4D Nucleome Project, provides unprecedented insights into how the physical structure of DNA influences gene regulation and cellular function[1][4][2].

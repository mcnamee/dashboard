The findings, published in the annual State of the Cryosphere report released in November ahead of the UN climate summit in Brazil, reveal that political resistance is undermining efforts to address the crisis[1][3][2].\n\nThe vast polar ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica lost around 370 billion tonnes of ice over the past year, while the world's 270,000 mountain glaciers shed an additional 270 billion tonnes[1][2][4]. This ice loss has contributed to sea level rise doubling from 2.1 millimeters per year in 1993 to 4.5 millimeters per year in 2024[5][6][7]. If this acceleration continues, sea levels could rise at a rate of one centimeter per year by the end of the century, forcing many coastal and island communities to relocate[1][2][4].\n\nIn February 2025, combined Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extent hit its lowest area ever recorded in the 47-year satellite record[1][3][8]. The Arctic reached its record-low maximum extent in March 2025, while Antarctica's summer minimum tied for second-lowest on record[9][10][11]. The report also confirmed that permafrost has become a net source of carbon emissions, releasing greenhouse gases roughly equivalent to the world's eighth-highest emitting country[1][12][4].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/a9611300-c5db-4605-ac1a-df4932fd7b84.mp3","url":"scientists-warn-melting-ice-ac-WSl5UAAhTCGJmhoTo2ZbVw","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/1eff582a-e1ea-4ed8-aa44-d4149edb21d8","published_datetime":"2025-12-19T06:06:40.525040","title":"UK gets first detailed worst-case climate scenarios","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/experts-warn-ongoing-concern-atlantic-020000551.html","name":"Experts warn ongoing concern with Atlantic Ocean will be direct ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--J4m6quKl--/t_limit/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2b9qLdEaEVGCL4jIFSoEyg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/c30cc75bcb03d4e9603514de44f7db68","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--u2DYQP9v--/t_thumbnail/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2b9qLdEaEVGCL4jIFSoEyg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/c30cc75bcb03d4e9603514de44f7db68"},"description":"British policymakers now have detailed worst-case climate scenarios for the first time, including the possibility of a 6°C temperature plunge if Atlantic Ocean currents collapse or a scorching 4°C rise by the end of the century, according to research published Thursday in the journal Earth's Future.\n\nScientists from the University of Reading have mapped out six long-term scenarios and multiple short-term extreme weather possibilities, filling a critical gap that left the UK unprepared for low-probability but high-impact climate outcomes.

The findings, published in Nature Astronomy in December, represent a landmark measurement that settles a long-standing scientific debate over whether the shell is thin or thick.[1][2][3]\n\n\"The 18-mile estimate relates to the cold, rigid, conductive outer-layer of a pure water ice shell,\" said Steve Levin, Juno project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"If an inner, slightly warmer convective layer also exists, which is possible, the total ice shell thickness would be even greater.\"[2][3]","audio_url":"","url":"nasa-and-scientists-reveal-new-HxZN.EY1SMi69pzpf8BglA","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/58979a8b-02aa-4118-9edd-483b5267951c","published_datetime":"2026-01-27T20:24:44.894718","title":"Tesla brand value drops 36% as Musk's politics erode trust","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/12/tesla-investor-survey-shows-85percent-believe-musks-politics-are-hurting-company.html","name":"Tesla investor survey shows 85% believe Musk's politics are ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s---EF8RsP0--/t_limit/https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108114691-17417820442025-03-11t202734z_1113171192_rc26bdacv9wn_rtrmadp_0_usa-trump.jpeg%3Fv%3D1741782084","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--g92N24M7--/t_thumbnail/https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108114691-17417820442025-03-11t202734z_1113171192_rc26bdacv9wn_rtrmadp_0_usa-trump.jpeg%3Fv%3D1741782084"},"description":"Tesla faces a crossroads this week as its brand value hits a three-year low and Wall Street braces for another year of declining profitability.

The object, designated 3I/ATLAS, shed unexpectedly large particles as it traveled through the solar system and displayed a rare wobbling jet structure never before observed in a visitor from another star.\n\nIn an essay published December 25, Loeb examined the comet's unusual \"anti-tail\"—a jet of material pointing toward the Sun rather than away from it—and determined that it contains particles significantly larger than typical comet dust[1]. While standard comet tails are dominated by particles around 0.5 microns in radius, the material in 3I/ATLAS's anti-tail measures between 1 and 100 microns, according to Loeb's analysis[2][1]. This size range is necessary to explain how the particles could travel the observed distance of up to 500,000 kilometers toward the Sun without being immediately stopped by solar radiation pressure[3][4][5].\n\n\"The observed length of the anti-tail produced by 3I/ATLAS can only be maintained by particles that are considerably larger than typical dust particles,\" Loeb wrote, adding that such features are difficult to explain using standard comet physics[2][1].","audio_url":"","url":"3iatlas-interstellar-comet-sho-E2bjZc8DSV2weaHLxyk_yw","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/6cacff4f-9080-4a07-970f-38adadafe29c","published_datetime":"2025-12-26T02:20:24.424398","title":"Zelenskyy speaks with Trump envoys on Christmas peace talks","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelensky-and-us-presidential-news-photo/2251524785","name":"Berlin Hosts Talks On Possible Ukraine Ceasefire","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/t_limit/v1766692089/getty_uploads/2251524785_kz3zdz.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/t_thumbnail/v1766692089/getty_uploads/2251524785_kz3zdz.jpg"},"description":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a phone conversation with US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner on Christmas Day, describing the discussions as \"very good\" and yielding productive ideas for achieving lasting peace in the nearly four-year war with Russia[1][2][3][4][5].\n\n\"We are truly working 24/7 to bring closer the end of this brutal Russian war against Ukraine and to make all documents and steps realistic, effective, and reliable,\" Zelenskyy wrote on social media following the December 25 call[1][3][4].

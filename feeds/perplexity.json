The findings suggest that increased ice shelf melting or reduced sea ice could disrupt this system, affecting rainfall in Africa and temperatures in Europe[1][2][3].\n\n\"This very cold, salty water, called Antarctic Bottom Water, is formed by the freezing of the ocean surface in sea ice factories that we call polynyas,\" said Dr. David Gwyther of The University of Queensland, who led the research team. \"This dense water sinks to the ocean floor where it flows northwards acting like a giant conveyor belt driving currents around the planet which influence the climate worldwide\"[1][2][3].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/fd377a02-b808-4342-82e1-fbe00c125236.mp3","url":"antarctic-ice-melt-threatens-g-6iXBJ6MZSdqhvjTwZWSdwQ","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/b66e939c-80ba-46b0-a967-feeed537fd35","published_datetime":"2025-12-19T02:45:15.105256","title":"US, EU sanction 70 shadow fleet vessels aiding Iran and Russia","featured_image":{"url":"https://bbcrussian.substack.com/p/shadow-fleet-from-smuggling-to-spying","name":"Shadow fleet — from smuggling to spying and sabotage","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--eAISObx_--/t_limit/https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/%24s_%21EDlO%21%2Cw_1200%2Ch_600%2Cc_fill%2Cf_jpg%2Cq_auto:good%2Cfl_progressive:steep%2Cg_auto/https%253A%252F%252Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Fce4ccf14-8762-459c-acbb-fd87f79ebb31_5000x2812.heic","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--4bABTGLl--/t_thumbnail/https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/%24s_%21EDlO%21%2Cw_1200%2Ch_600%2Cc_fill%2Cf_jpg%2Cq_auto:good%2Cfl_progressive:steep%2Cg_auto/https%253A%252F%252Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Fce4ccf14-8762-459c-acbb-fd87f79ebb31_5000x2812.heic"},"description":"The United States and European Union launched coordinated sanctions Wednesday targeting 70 vessels accused of helping Iran and Russia circumvent international oil export restrictions, marking a significant escalation in Western efforts to cut off revenue streams financing Tehran's military programs and Moscow's war in Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned 29 vessels and their management firms for transporting hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Iranian petroleum products through deceptive shipping practices, according to a Treasury statement[1][2].

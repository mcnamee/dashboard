a geopolitical dispute that had already rattled markets this week.[1][2][3]\n\nThe standoff escalated after Trump said he would impose new duties on eight European countries beginning Feb. 1 unless an arrangement was reached over Greenland—then reversed course in Davos, saying he would not use force and that a “framework” with NATO was in view, prompting a relief bounce in

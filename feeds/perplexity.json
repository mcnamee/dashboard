Graduate student Matthew Nelson discovered that unwanted photons produced during laser operations share nearly identical wavelength and waveform characteristics with the interfering laser light itself[1][3]. This similarity allows the two noise sources to be tuned to cancel each other out through destructive interference, yielding a significantly cleaner stream of single photons—the fundamental units needed for photonic quantum systems[4][1][2].","audio_url":"","url":"university-of-iowa-scientists-YDesh._aRUWiKYA6ZP_0GQ","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/966c667a-9ac5-4476-9489-ef04760ff13c","published_datetime":"2025-12-25T06:36:04.386326","title":"Nvidia licenses Groq's AI chip tech, hires execs in $20B deal","featured_image":{"url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-acquires-ai-chip-challenger-220316328.html","name":"Nvidia to license AI chip challenger Groq’s tech and hire its CEO","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--6iIw80ZS--/t_limit/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Id1gqYnQ49JNEJz7_C0uzw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_finance_785/7fd4ac685be0170266c41c9de525da65","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--QM6YCteI--/t_thumbnail/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Id1gqYnQ49JNEJz7_C0uzw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_finance_785/7fd4ac685be0170266c41c9de525da65"},"description":"Nvidia has reached a complex $20 billion agreement with AI chip startup Groq that stops short of a full acquisition, marking the chip giant's largest deal as it races to dominate the fast-growing AI inference market.\n\nThe transaction, announced on Christmas Eve, involves Nvidia licensing Groq's inference technology and hiring its top executives, including founder Jonathan Ross and President Sunny Madra, while Groq continues operating independently. The arrangement blurs traditional dealmaking lines, reflecting a new Silicon Valley trend where tech giants cherry-pick talent and intellectual property without fully absorbing companies.\n\nCNBC reported the $20 billion valuation, citing Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led Groq's latest funding round[1]. However, neither Nvidia nor Groq confirmed financial terms. In a blog post, Groq characterized the arrangement as a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement\" for its inference technology[2]. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang clarified in an employee email obtained by CNBC that while the company is \"adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groq's IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company\"[1][3].\n\nDavis told CNBC that Nvidia is acquiring Groq's assets, excluding its cloud business[1]. Simon Edwards, formerly Groq's chief financial officer, will become CEO of the continuing entity, with GroqCloud operations uninterrupted[2][4].","audio_url":"","url":"nvidia-acquires-groq-in-20-bil-xuuy0fT_SiKo4LT7LJnhUg","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/33fdd071-8a27-4f12-9077-7448d30ae152","published_datetime":"2025-12-25T05:13:47.104150","title":"AI maps 360,000 DNA knots regulating gene activity","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-021-00736-9","name":"Chemical profiling of DNA G-quadruplex-interacting proteins ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--EPySYoCY--/t_limit/https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%253A10.1038%252Fs41557-021-00736-9/MediaObjects/41557_2021_736_Figa_HTML.png","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--5OQe0h-f--/t_thumbnail/https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%253A10.1038%252Fs41557-021-00736-9/MediaObjects/41557_2021_736_Figa_HTML.png"},"description":"An international research team has created the first comprehensive map of DNA quadruplexes—temporary knot-like structures that regulate when genes turn on and off—using artificial intelligence to identify approximately 360,000 of these formations across the human genome[1][2].

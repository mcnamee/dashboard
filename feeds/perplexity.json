PDVSA approved the emergency plan on December 23, focusing first on the Junin area's extra-heavy crude operations before moving to the Ayacucho and Carabobo regions, which produce lighter grades[1][4][5].

The aircraft carried 227 passengers, predominantly Chinese nationals, along with 12 Malaysian crew members[5][2][3]. Military radar later revealed the plane had deviated sharply from its flight path, turning back over northern Malaysia before heading into the Andaman Sea and then southward, after which all contact was lost[5][7][3].","audio_url":"","url":"search-for-missing-malaysia-ai-bNKKtvkyTJykyeLpVMxL.Q","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/37757a1a-4735-4b4e-b9b7-47334eee3171","published_datetime":"2025-12-29T17:04:23.415323","title":"Zelensky seeks 50-year US security guarantees","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/28/us/politics/trump-zelensky-peace-ukraine-putin.html","name":"Trump and Zelensky Meet to Iron Out Peace Plan, but Deal Remains Elusive","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--DA2I9lZ5--/t_limit/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/28/us/politics/28dc-PREXY/28TrumpZelensky-facebookJumbo.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--Qq3DYd8L--/t_thumbnail/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/28/us/politics/28dc-PREXY/28TrumpZelensky-facebookJumbo.jpg"},"description":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday requested US security guarantees lasting up to 50 years, arguing that Ukraine needs longer-term commitments than the 15-year guarantee currently proposed in peace plan discussions with President Donald Trump.\n\nFollowing their December 28 meeting at Mar-a-Lago, Zelensky told reporters that while draft documents include \"strong\" US security guarantees for 15 years with the possibility of extension, he pressed Trump to consider a significantly longer timeframe[1][2][3][4]. \"I told him that we are already at war and it has been going on for almost 15 years,\" Zelensky said in a WhatsApp message to journalists, referencing the conflict that began with Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine[4][5][6]. \"I told him that we would really like to consider the possibility of 30, 40, 50 years,\" he added[1][7][6].\n\nTrump responded that he would \"think about\" the proposal, according to Zelensky[8][7][9]. The president offered no immediate commitment, though both leaders described the two-hour meeting as productive and suggested progress toward ending the nearly four-year full-scale war.","audio_url":"","url":"zelensky-seeks-50-year-us-secu-iXn_NMhRSXyuZkQhxmsEDw","partition_name":"partition1"}]}

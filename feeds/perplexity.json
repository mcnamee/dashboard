The findings reveal that scientists who adopt AI publish 3.02 times as many papers and receive nearly five times as many citations as their peers who do not use AI. They also reach leadership positions about 1.5 years earlier.[1][2]\n\nYet this individual success comes at a cost to the broader scientific enterprise. AI-driven research covers 4.6% less topical territory than conventional studies and spawns 22% less engagement between papers.[2][1]","audio_url":"","url":"ai-boosts-scientist-output-but-0lLSxp6ESJqep2Cbyr3mTA","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/147bbf96-8220-48e3-8b64-f4278a96192a","published_datetime":"2026-01-14T16:38:11.737255","title":"Denmark deploys troops to Greenland as officials meet at White House","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.newsweek.com/greenland-trump-us-denmark-nato-white-house-arctic-11347275","name":"Greenland Live: Denmark Deploys Advance Troops as Trump Threatens Takeover","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--R42PvHX2--/t_limit/https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25346538084040.jpg%3Fw%3D1200crop%253D1","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--SxkCmJZC--/t_thumbnail/https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25346538084040.jpg%3Fw%3D1200crop%253D1"},"description":"Denmark announced on Wednesday it is deploying military units and equipment to Greenland starting immediately, as officials from Copenhagen and Nuuk arrived at the White House for high-stakes talks over President Donald Trump's escalating demands to acquire the Arctic territory.\n\n\"The Danish armed forces are, from today, deploying capabilities and units related to exercise activities.

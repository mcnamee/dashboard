However, at least one in five systems degrade at least 1.5 times faster than this typical rate, and roughly one in 12 degrade twice as fast.\"\n\nFor operators of solar farms where hundreds of thousands of panels are installed, the findings represent a hidden financial risk that challenges the economic models underpinning the industry's growth[1][2][3].","audio_url":"","url":"unsw-study-finds-20-percent-of-n5ni8eJ0T8uzqEg5PEng1Q","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/abe3b6a4-92a5-4877-87c4-90dd5487c3d1","published_datetime":"2026-01-06T15:27:06.857293","title":"Nvidia AI boom drives laptop prices up 15-20%","featured_image":{"url":"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-ceo-ai-breakthrough-completely-113042227.html","name":"Nvidia CEO: This AI 'breakthrough' is 'completely genius'","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--O-_W4ZpU--/t_limit/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cZ.A2i8c94ZsFbUfOpDN6w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/b3e6e620-ea81-11f0-bffe-5b3879265f0c","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--eWmub_YE--/t_thumbnail/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cZ.A2i8c94ZsFbUfOpDN6w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/b3e6e620-ea81-11f0-bffe-5b3879265f0c"},"description":"Nvidia unveiled its most powerful AI computing platform yet at CES 2026 on Monday, even as the chip giant's insatiable demand for memory components drives laptop prices to unprecedented heights, leaving consumers caught in the crossfire of the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe company's Rubin platform, announced by CEO Jensen Huang in Las Vegas, promises five times the AI performance of its predecessor while slashing computing costs[1][2][3][4].

Pre-orders for laptops with the new processors begin January 6, with systems shipping globally starting January 27[3][5].","audio_url":"","url":"intel-and-amd-launch-new-chips-99b3fWTUS.ab5hN3FlZrkA","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/3b9b9f11-4ed7-41a2-8bb1-69c729460962","published_datetime":"2026-01-06T00:17:10.373542","title":"Massive early galaxies took different paths, astronomers find","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250819072201.htm","name":"Mysterious “little red dots” could reveal how the first ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--U9Si_q7k--/t_limit/https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/distant-red-galaxies-black-hole-stars.webp","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--ab7oZDAb--/t_thumbnail/https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/distant-red-galaxies-black-hole-stars.webp"},"description":"Astronomers have discovered that the universe's most massive galaxies followed strikingly different evolutionary paths in their infancy, with some shutting down star formation early while others remained vigorously active but cloaked in dust.\n\nThe findings, presented today at the 247th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Phoenix, reveal that ultramassive galaxies containing more than 100 billion stars exhibited diverse behaviors less than 2 billion years after the Big Bang[1][2]. The research challenges assumptions that galaxy evolution proceeded uniformly in the early universe.\n\n\"What is striking is not just that we can detect hidden activity, but that we see such diversity among galaxies with similar masses at the same epoch,\" said Gillian Wilson, vice chancellor for research at UC Merced and professor of physics, who mentored the study[1]. \"That tells us that the shutdown of star formation in the most massive galaxies was neither uniform nor simple.\"","audio_url":"","url":"astronomers-uncover-early-univ-n5Oz8Og7QOCsbDo2Ei5O4Q","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/e5db2d28-bdf3-4fcf-be77-3a573a1d1240","published_datetime":"2026-01-05T22:41:45.975169","title":"Nvidia, AMD CEOs unveil AI roadmaps as CES 2026 opens","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.marketscreener.com/news/nvidia-ceo-huang-touts-automotive-ai-at-ces-talk-as-competition-mounts-ce7e59dedf80f52d","name":"Nvidia CEO Huang touts automotive AI at CES talk as competition mounts","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--Xakd-Y3y--/t_limit/https://cdn.zonebourse.com/static/resize/0/0/images/reuters/2026-01/2026-01-05T220947Z_1_LYNXMPEM0416L_RTROPTP_4_TECH-CES-NVIDIA.JPG","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--MeB1pmYM--/t_thumbnail/https://cdn.zonebourse.com/static/resize/0/0/images/reuters/2026-01/2026-01-05T220947Z_1_LYNXMPEM0416L_RTROPTP_4_TECH-CES-NVIDIA.JPG"},"description":"The annual Consumer Electronics Show opened Monday in Las Vegas with artificial intelligence and robotics dominating the event's first day, as Nvidia and AMD CEOs outlined their visions for AI's future while manufacturers unveiled a new generation of home robots designed to handle everyday household tasks.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang kicked off the show's keynote presentations at 1 p.m. PT, focusing on what he called the \"Physical AI\" era—artificial intelligence that can understand and operate in the real world[1][2][3][4].

The unrest represents the largest wave of protests in Iran since 2022, when the death of Mahsa Amini sparked nationwide demonstrations[1][2][3].\n\nSemi-official media and rights groups reported multiple fatalities in at least three provinces. Fars news agency said two people were killed in Lordegan, a city in western Iran, during clashes between security services and protesters[5][6][7]. The human rights organization Hengaw corroborated deaths in Lordegan, saying security forces opened fire on demonstrators[8][5][9]. Another death was reported in Isfahan province in central Iran[5][6][7].\n\nAuthorities confirmed one person killed in Kuhdasht, a western city, though accounts of the incident diverged sharply. State media identified the deceased as Amirhossam Khodayari Fard, a 21-year-old member of the Basij paramilitary unit[2][5][10][7]. The Revolutionary Guards said 13 other militia members were wounded and accused demonstrators of \"taking advantage of the atmosphere of popular protests\"[7][5]. However, Hengaw said Khodayari Fard was a protester killed by security forces[5][6][7].

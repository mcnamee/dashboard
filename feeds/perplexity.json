The past decade represents the 10 warmest years on record for the region[1][2][3]. In March 2025, Arctic winter sea ice reached its lowest annual maximum extent in the 47-year satellite record[1][4][5].\n\nResearch published this week in the journal Science Advances documents a sharp increase in extreme weather events across the Arctic over the past 30 years[6][7][8].

Five years ago, a catastrophic drought turned his fertile land to dust, killing thousands of native kangaroos and forcing him to reconsider the future of his century-old family farm. Today, those same fields host part of the massive MacIntyre Wind Farm, generating power for 700,000 homes—and providing Finlay with crucial supplemental income as agriculture grows increasingly unpredictable[1][2].\n\nHis story reflects a broader economic shift gaining momentum worldwide. As renewable energy costs continue their precipitous decline, a rapid transition away from fossil fuels has emerged as not just an environmental imperative, but an enormous economic opportunity. According to a University of Oxford study, transitioning to renewable energy by 2050 could save the global economy at least $12 trillion in energy system costs compared to maintaining current fossil fuel use[3][4][5].","audio_url":"","url":"clean-energy-shift-could-save-NR679qq2Skuq9WL4KOuJXg","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/56c7df57-f592-4444-99a5-8fc1a5695d82","published_datetime":"2026-01-08T01:06:41.305949","title":"Trump admin weighs military option for Greenland purchase","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/07/nx-s1-5670244/trump-greenland","name":"White House says 'all options' on the table for Greenland - NPR","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--mpoQsa3k--/t_limit/https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8640x4860%2B0%2B450/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fff%252F73%252Fa326640b4643b0bebb46d53e4c1b%252Fap26007350267999.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--A4RzQWQb--/t_thumbnail/https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8640x4860%2B0%2B450/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fff%252F73%252Fa326640b4643b0bebb46d53e4c1b%252Fap26007350267999.jpg"},"description":"President Donald Trump's administration is actively discussing the acquisition of Greenland from Denmark, with White House officials confirming that military action remains on the table despite diplomatic efforts taking priority[1][2][3].

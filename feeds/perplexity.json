Five years ago, a catastrophic drought turned his fertile land to dust, killing thousands of native kangaroos and forcing him to reconsider the future of his century-old family farm. Today, those same fields host part of the massive MacIntyre Wind Farm, generating power for 700,000 homes—and providing Finlay with crucial supplemental income as agriculture grows increasingly unpredictable[1][2].\n\nHis story reflects a broader economic shift gaining momentum worldwide. As renewable energy costs continue their precipitous decline, a rapid transition away from fossil fuels has emerged as not just an environmental imperative, but an enormous economic opportunity. According to a University of Oxford study, transitioning to renewable energy by 2050 could save the global economy at least $12 trillion in energy system costs compared to maintaining current fossil fuel use[3][4][5].","audio_url":"","url":"clean-energy-shift-could-save-NR679qq2Skuq9WL4KOuJXg","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/56c7df57-f592-4444-99a5-8fc1a5695d82","published_datetime":"2026-01-08T01:06:41.305949","title":"Trump admin weighs military option for Greenland purchase","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/07/nx-s1-5670244/trump-greenland","name":"White House says 'all options' on the table for Greenland - NPR","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--mpoQsa3k--/t_limit/https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8640x4860%2B0%2B450/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fff%252F73%252Fa326640b4643b0bebb46d53e4c1b%252Fap26007350267999.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--A4RzQWQb--/t_thumbnail/https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8640x4860%2B0%2B450/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fff%252F73%252Fa326640b4643b0bebb46d53e4c1b%252Fap26007350267999.jpg"},"description":"President Donald Trump's administration is actively discussing the acquisition of Greenland from Denmark, with White House officials confirming that military action remains on the table despite diplomatic efforts taking priority[1][2][3].

Using the platform to analyze a B-21-type configuration with 288 parameters, the team found that aerodynamic optimization could increase the aircraft's lift-to-drag ratio by approximately 15 percent and improve the pitching moment from -0.2 to nearly zero, suggesting the current design may not achieve optimal stability for level flight[1][2][4].\n\nThe research comes as the B-21 Raider, built by Northrop Grumman, undergoes intensive flight testing at Edwards Air Force Base in California[4][5][6]. A second test aircraft joined the program in September 2025, marking what Air Force Secretary Troy Meink called \"substantial momentum\" for the sixth-generation stealth bomber[5][6][7].","audio_url":"","url":"china-finds-flaws-in-us-b-21-b-te_hNXqcQWe69BWf1pn.XA","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/1b7452c7-01ec-4a18-ac18-2022804ccdbb","published_datetime":"2026-01-07T15:05:21.555545","title":"Venezuela stocks surge on Maduro ouster, US oil deal","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/06/venezuela-bonds-are-the-hottest-trade-on-wall-street-this-week-but-risks-remain.html","name":"Venezuela bonds are the hottest trade on Wall Street this week, but ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--JTx3RhnZ--/t_limit/https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108248430-17676476452026-01-05t210851z_1141386342_rc25viabdpif_rtrmadp_0_usa-venezuela.jpeg%3Fv%3D1767647717%26w%3D1920%26h%3D1080","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--EOEK64FQ--/t_thumbnail/https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108248430-17676476452026-01-05t210851z_1141386342_rc25viabdpif_rtrmadp_0_usa-venezuela.jpeg%3Fv%3D1767647717%26w%3D1920%26h%3D1080"},"description":"Venezuela's stock market soared in the days following the January 3 capture of President Nicolás Maduro by US forces, with the Caracas Stock Exchange's IBC index surging 50% on Tuesday and adding another 16% on Monday—a combined gain of roughly 73% since the military operation[1][2][3].

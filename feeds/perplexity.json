Alphabet disclosed in its third-quarter 2025 earnings that capital expenditures for 2025 would reach around $85 billion, with expectations of further increases in 2026[5][6]. Microsoft spent $34.9 billion on capital expenditures in the first quarter of its fiscal 2026, with half allocated to short-lived assets like GPUs and CPUs[5][4].\n\nYet this spending spree is raising concerns among fund managers about inflation pressures that could force central banks to halt interest rate cuts. \"You need a pin to burst the bubble, and it will likely come through tighter monetary conditions,\" said Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management[7][1]. Morgan Stanley strategist Andrew Sheets projects U.S. consumer price inflation will remain above the Federal Reserve's 2% target until late 2027, partly due to substantial corporate investments in AI[7][1].","audio_url":"","url":"ai-spending-boom-sparks-inflat-9oHMaZuaRrWwO3Ah64KZlw","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/8667ffb2-a42b-4310-8a12-690cf8ff32c2","published_datetime":"2026-01-05T05:20:45.713222","title":"Samsung warns memory chip shortage to raise tech prices","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/samsung-elec-names-mobile-chief-new-co-ceo-2025-11-21/","name":"Samsung Elec names mobile chief co-CEO in return to ... - Reuters","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--BoWrFvkP--/t_limit/https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WD6GKO75AZNOZA5IZCG6BO3WKI.jpg%3Fauth%3D38e9ef5d331592f779efd09368a44572b9dbf7bb346a79572203f92b06cb2137%26height%3D1005%26width%3D1920%26quality%3D80%26smart%3Dtrue","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--gY_xPMr5--/t_thumbnail/https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WD6GKO75AZNOZA5IZCG6BO3WKI.jpg%3Fauth%3D38e9ef5d331592f779efd09368a44572b9dbf7bb346a79572203f92b06cb2137%26height%3D1005%26width%3D1920%26quality%3D80%26smart%3Dtrue"},"description":"Samsung co-CEO TM Roh warned that an \"unprecedented\" memory chip shortage is hitting the technology industry, with price increases for smartphones and TVs now \"inevitable\" as manufacturers grapple with surging costs driven by insatiable demand from artificial intelligence data centers[1][2][3].\n\n\"As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact,\" Roh told Reuters in an interview published January 4, adding that the crisis affects not only mobile phones but other consumer electronics, from TVs to home appliances[1][2].

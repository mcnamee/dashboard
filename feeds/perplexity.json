The panels that powered the clean energy transition were built to withstand decades of harsh weather but were never designed to be repaired, refurbished, or disassembled.","audio_url":"","url":"solar-boom-risks-250-million-t-e7KeUW4EQ4SkiHCbgAFRwg","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/fbd6c044-9af8-4115-bd6d-4674bf432540","published_datetime":"2026-01-13T16:05:43.232822","title":"Meta cuts 1,000 Reality Labs jobs, shifting focus to AI glasses","featured_image":{"url":"https://au.pcmag.com/vr/115312/meta-is-reportedly-laying-off-hundreds-of-metaverse-employees-this-week","name":"Meta Is Reportedly Laying Off Hundreds of Metaverse Employees This Week","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--nKKdiNci--/t_limit/https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_au/news/m/meta-is-re/meta-is-reportedly-laying-off-hundreds-of-metaverse-employee_4kw2.1200.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--nkhlEZ_X--/t_thumbnail/https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_au/news/m/meta-is-re/meta-is-reportedly-laying-off-hundreds-of-metaverse-employee_4kw2.1200.jpg"},"description":"Meta Platforms has begun notifying more than 1,000 employees in its Reality Labs division of layoffs, marking a decisive retreat from the virtual reality and metaverse ambitions that once defined the company's future.

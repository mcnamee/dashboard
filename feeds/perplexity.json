A small copper paddle placed within the swirling metal is carried along by these internal flows, creating rotation at speeds of up to 320 revolutions per minute.[1][2][3]\n\n\"This is a completely new way to create motion,\" said Dr Priyank Kumar, a UNSW Senior Lecturer who supervised the project and served as the corresponding author on a paper published in npj Flexible Electronics. \"We're harnessing the flow of liquid metal itself to produce rotation, without any traditional moving parts.

A comprehensive international study published January 27 in Nature Plants warns that fast-growing tree species are increasingly dominating forest ecosystems worldwide, displacing slower-growing native trees and reducing both biodiversity and long-term carbon storage capacity.[1][2][3]\n\nThe research team analyzed more than 31,000 tree species globally and found that forests are becoming homogenized as fast-growing varieties such as acacia, eucalyptus, poplar, and pine outcompete specialized native species. Nearly 41 percent of naturalized tree species—those that have established wild populations outside their native ranges—possess traits like rapid growth and small leaves that make them well-suited to disturbed environments but unable to fulfill the ecological roles of the species they replace.[2][4][1]","audio_url":"","url":"fast-growing-trees-threaten-fo-68x8sfWkT3S4p3f_KysSyA","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/3c0fa74e-c751-4045-8c3d-2ac18cddddf9","published_datetime":"2026-01-28T18:08:09.438395","title":"Bank of Canada holds rates steady, warns Fed independence threats add to global instability","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/threat-feds-independence-boosts-economic-uncertainty-says-bank-canada-head-2026-01-28/","name":"Threat to Fed's independence boosts economic uncertainty, says ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--grDkbIlI--/t_limit/https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TZ5P3SS5IZL5HE6KA4CIMMIHLU.jpg%3Fauth%3Dbe1acfad6715cf76f31dadcee85218502e911057ec907cf2a47fba402b72c599%26height%3D1005%26width%3D1920%26quality%3D80%26smart%3Dtrue","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--U9HLb1C5--/t_thumbnail/https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TZ5P3SS5IZL5HE6KA4CIMMIHLU.jpg%3Fauth%3Dbe1acfad6715cf76f31dadcee85218502e911057ec907cf2a47fba402b72c599%26height%3D1005%26width%3D1920%26quality%3D80%26smart%3Dtrue"},"description":"The Bank of Canada on Wednesday maintained its benchmark interest rate at 2.25 percent, while the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep its policy rate unchanged in the 3.5-3.75 percent range when it announces its decision later today.

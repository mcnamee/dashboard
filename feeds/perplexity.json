The codes achieved a frame error rate as low as 10⁻⁴ for systems with hundreds of thousands of qubits, with decoding complexity that scales proportionally to the number of physical qubits—addressing a major barrier to practical quantum computing[1][2].\n\nTraditional quantum error-correction methods hit an accuracy ceiling far below theoretical limits, requiring heavy computation that made large-scale systems impractical[1][2]. Kasai and Master's student Daiki Komoto constructed low-density parity-check codes defined over non-binary finite fields that handle both bit-flip and phase-flip errors simultaneously[3][5]. \"Our quantum error-correcting code has a greater than 1/2 code rate, targeting hundreds of thousands of logical qubits,\" Kasai said[3][4].

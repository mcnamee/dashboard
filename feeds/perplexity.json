The rare cosmic object has exhibited unpredictable trajectory changes and unusual features that challenge standard comet models, intensifying calls for the release of raw observational data[3][4].\n\nIn late December, astronomers observed that 3I/ATLAS had deviated from its predicted path due to non-gravitational acceleration—forces not accounted for by gravity alone[3][5]. According to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, the comet experienced a \"radial acceleration away from the Sun of 1.1x10^{-6} au per day squared,\" which would require the object to have shed approximately 13 percent of its total mass during its October perihelion passage[5][6].

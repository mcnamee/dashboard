closest partners from Venezuela to Iran and Cuba are reassessing what Moscow’s backing is worth, after a series of crises in which Vladimir Putin’s government appeared either unable—or unwilling—to step in.\n\nThe clearest warning sign has come in Venezuela, where the U.S. operation that captured President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3 has exposed gaps in the security ecosystem Caracas built with Russian and Cuban help—and showcased the limits of Russia’s power projection as it remains fixated on Ukraine.[1][2][3]","audio_url":"","url":"putin-s-allies-feel-abandoned-HnD45qt.Tz6aXs903x5ZnQ","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/3c32fc10-7cce-4c8b-b3b1-d42ebe2ee6d1","published_datetime":"2026-01-14T17:49:50.441029","title":"Starlink

the James Webb Space Telescope began operations in late 2021, one of its most perplexing discoveries has been hundreds of tiny, unexplained red points scattered throughout images of the early universe. Now, researchers from the University of Copenhagen have cracked the mystery: these \"little red dots\" are young supermassive black holes hidden within dense cocoons of ionized gas.\n\nThe findings, published Wednesday in Nature, reveal that these enigmatic objects are far less massive than scientists initially believed—about 100 times smaller—yet still weigh up to 10 million times the mass of our Sun.[1][2]","audio_url":"","url":"scientists-identify-little-red-XeGg3Q7oT8uJJA3NY2pvPg","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/c4e7ae51-2c8a-42a3-aa9c-a0fd15518a56","published_datetime":"2026-01-14T17:35:06.981034","title":"Half the world's major river deltas sink faster than seas rise","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2511539-sinking-river-deltas-put-millions-at-risk-of-flooding/","name":"Sinking river deltas put millions at risk of flooding | New ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--6aHvNasl--/t_limit/https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/14121207/SEI_280652732.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--mQ1GR012--/t_thumbnail/https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/14121207/SEI_280652732.jpg"},"description":"Nearly half of the world's largest river deltas, including the Nile, Ganges, and Mekong, are sinking faster than global sea levels are rising, according to new research published Wednesday in Nature. The study warns that more than 236 million people face heightened flooding risk as human-caused land subsidence emerges as the dominant threat to these coastal regions.\n\nThe research, led by scientists at the University of California, Irvine and Virginia Tech, provides the first high-resolution, delta-wide assessment of elevation loss across 40 major river deltas spanning five continents. Using satellite radar data collected between 2014 and 2023, the team found that 18 of those deltas are experiencing average annual subsidence rates that exceed the current global sea-level rise rate of about 4 millimeters per year.[1][2][3]","audio_url":"","url":"major-river-deltas-sink-faster-14a6flasQPmeB.aMrVS6.A","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/5723d9ae-6045-4251-a1c0-f9c411f9beb4","published_datetime":"2026-01-14T17:32:59.445146","title":"Musk denies Grok generated explicit images of minors","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/poster-featuring-an-image-of-us-billionaire-and-businessman-news-photo/2255514345","name":"BRITAIN-US-COMPUTERS-AI-X-GROK","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/t_limit/v1768411802/getty_uploads/2255514345_atgepf.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/t_thumbnail/v1768411802/getty_uploads/2255514345_atgepf.jpg"},"description":"Elon Musk said on Wednesday he was unaware of any explicit images of minors generated by his xAI chatbot Grok, even as global regulatory pressure against the AI tool reached a fever pitch with government investigations spanning three continents.\n\n\"I not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok.

The findings reveal that scientists who adopt AI publish 3.02 times as many papers and receive nearly five times as many citations as their peers who do not use AI. They also reach leadership positions about 1.5 years earlier.[1][2]\n\nYet this individual success comes at a cost to the broader scientific enterprise. AI-driven research covers 4.6% less topical territory than conventional studies and spawns 22% less engagement between papers.[2][1]","audio_url":"","url":"ai-boosts-scientist-output-but-0lLSxp6ESJqep2Cbyr3mTA","partition_name":"partition1"}]}

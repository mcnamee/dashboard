Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who has been analyzing the data, says the geometric precision of the formation is difficult to reconcile with standard cometary outgassing and raises questions about the object's origins.\n\nImages captured by Hubble on January 7 and January 14, 2026, and processed by researcher Toni Scarmato using the Larson-Sekanina Rotational Gradient filter, show three collimated mini-jets extending tens of thousands of kilometers into space, each separated by exactly 120 degrees in projection. A fourth \"anti-tail\" jet points directly toward the sun, stretching up to 400,000 kilometers — a length that Loeb argues has never been reported before for solar system comets.[1][2][3][4]","audio_url":"","url":"harvard-astrophysicist-finds-u-G4JmLTFmQYSyzXGwgBWNbg","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/ffd211bb-1a60-490e-a550-3b3b0c917a43","published_datetime":"2026-01-20T10:39:46.273176","title":"Chinese researchers achieve 31% efficiency in perovskite solar cells","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3224393/chinese-scientists-boost-perovskite-solar-cell-efficiency","name":"Chinese scientists boost perovskite solar cell efficiency ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--PRDheKhS--/t_limit/https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1020x680/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/16/107dc2a4-a19c-4e18-b074-4fda5b97a3fc_6d1fe96c.jpg%3Fitok%3DCToEKhVx%26v%3D1686921015","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--LpXt75kJ--/t_thumbnail/https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1020x680/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/16/107dc2a4-a19c-4e18-b074-4fda5b97a3fc_6d1fe96c.jpg%3Fitok%3DCToEKhVx%26v%3D1686921015"},"description":"Scientists in China and Hong Kong have announced separate advances in perovskite solar cell technology this month, addressing long-standing challenges with both efficiency and stability that have hindered the material's commercial adoption.\n\nA research team from Northwestern Polytechnical University, in collaboration with Xi'an Shiyou University and Xidian University, developed a novel crystallization strategy using a two-dimensional seeding agent to achieve 31.13% efficiency in a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell.

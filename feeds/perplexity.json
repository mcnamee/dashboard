Framework Convention on Climate Change, the 1992 treaty that underpins the Paris climate agreement[6][1][2].\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio defended the move in a statement, saying the Trump administration determined the organizations were \"redundant, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run\" or advancing agendas inconsistent with U.S. interests[10][11][12].

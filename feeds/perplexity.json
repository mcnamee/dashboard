But a new strand of physics research is reviving an old, unsettling possibility: **time may not be fundamental at all**, and what humans experience as “flow” could instead be a byproduct of how the universe stores and spreads information.\n\nIn an essay published January 28, physicist Florian Neukart of Leiden University argued that modern physics still lacks a unified account of time, in part because its two pillars treat it differently: **Einstein’s relativity** folds time into spacetime, while **quantum mechanics** typically assumes time as an external parameter. Attempts to combine the two, he wrote, can even yield equations in which time “disappears,” a long-running difficulty known as the “problem of time”.[1][2][3]","audio_url":"","url":"physicists-question-whether-ti-KmFzvPmPTsKznw5NtcFpew","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/23abe8c8-ea80-471a-a4ee-598a0d11809d","published_datetime":"2026-01-29T05:51:20.188588","title":"SAP authorizes $10B buyback as cloud revenue hits record","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.techmonitor.ai/hardware/cloud/sap-boosts-2025-forecast-cloud-revenue-growth-accelerates","name":"SAP boosts 2025 forecast as cloud revenue growth accelerates","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--F-20cX9N--/t_limit/https://www.techmonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/01/shutterstock_2423167951.webp","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--DlY1O6AS--/t_thumbnail/https://www.techmonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/01/shutterstock_2423167951.webp"},"description":"SAP reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 results showing continued momentum in its cloud business, with cloud revenue rising to €5.61 billion in Q4 and total cloud backlog reaching a record €77 billion.

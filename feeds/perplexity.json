The Voyager probe, launched in 1977, travels at 17 kilometers per second and will require another 28,000 years to reach the assumed edge of the solar system, according to Loeb's calculations[1]. In contrast, 3I/ATLAS moves at 60 kilometers per second, cutting the journey time by more than two-thirds[1].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/404e6f31-1375-46f1-af10-d71b9d8d75b1.mp3","url":"harvard-s-loeb-calls-3iatlas-a-2DgcjYmoQLS0msGEhaO6OA","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/6fbae154-5168-454f-bf6c-780b9bae2a51","published_datetime":"2025-12-22T14:13:46.058858","title":"NBA and FIBA to launch new European basketball league in 2027","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6435965/2025/06/18/nba-europe-euroleague-tony-parker/","name":"As NBA plans for new pro league in Europe progress, EuroLeague ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--X4bj8CU8--/t_limit/https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/06/18150959/GettyImages-2206568267-scaled.jpg%3Fwidth%3D1200%26height%3D630%26fit%3Dcover","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--TkBFCX3n--/t_thumbnail/https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/06/18150959/GettyImages-2206568267-scaled.jpg%3Fwidth%3D1200%26height%3D630%26fit%3Dcover"},"description":"The NBA and world governing body FIBA will begin formally approaching European clubs and owners in January about joining a new continent-wide basketball league, with a working launch target of October 2027.[1][2][3] The project, years in the making, would create a top-tier competition backed by the NBA’s commercial machine but structured around Europe’s traditional promotion-and-qualification model.[1][4][5]\n\nAt the heart of the proposal is a hybrid format that combines guaranteed places for a core group of clubs with annual access via sporting merit. Current models under discussion focus on a 16-team league with 12 permanent members and four qualification spots, earned through FIBA’s Basketball Champions League or a postseason tournament.[6][1][5][2] All clubs playing in FIBA-affiliated European leagues would have a theoretical path into the new competition.[6][1][5]\n\nFIBA secretary general Andreas Zagklis said the format “respects European sport model principles by offering any ambitious club in the continent a fair pathway to the top,” while NBA commissioner Adam Silver described the initiative as “an enormous opportunity” to grow the professional game in Europe.[6][1][2][3]","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/6fbae154-5168-454f-bf6c-780b9bae2a51.mp3","url":"nba-and-fiba-plan-new-european-665kwGgyQpO5.3MgsIjvug","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/929a3eef-a94d-4ae9-bf96-784a69592a9e","published_datetime":"2025-12-22T13:33:11.026484","title":"Ukraine's $1,000 drones reshape air defense economics","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/ukraine-deploys-low-cost-drones-055434675.html","name":"Ukraine deploys low-cost drones to counter Russian attacks, in photos","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--nC2QqH3X--/t_limit/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KH055I6v_VsWONsV1Mk31w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/798f288b6f355c0f2ada8add28f6510a","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--EFuY3pwN--/t_thumbnail/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KH055I6v_VsWONsV1Mk31w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/798f288b6f355c0f2ada8add28f6510a"},"description":"Ukraine has rapidly scaled production of low-cost interceptor drones to nearly 950 units per day, fundamentally reshaping air defense as nightly Russian attacks continue to pummel cities and infrastructure. The interceptors, which cost as little as $1,000, have shot down more than 1,500 enemy drones in recent months while preserving expensive missiles for faster threats[1][2][3].\n\nOn the night of December 21-22, Russian forces launched 86 attack drones at Ukraine, with air defenses shooting down 58[4][5]. The assault followed a pattern that has intensified throughout 2025, with Russia deploying approximately 5,500 Shahed-type drones monthly against Ukrainian targets[6].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/929a3eef-a94d-4ae9-bf96-784a69592a9e.mp3","url":"ukraine-deploys-cheap-drones-t-AK0Wcjl_Qq2Nft.bHgodxw","partition_name":"partition1"}]}

Using the platform to analyze a B-21-type configuration with 288 parameters, the team found that aerodynamic optimization could increase the aircraft's lift-to-drag ratio by approximately 15 percent and improve the pitching moment from -0.2 to nearly zero, suggesting the current design may not achieve optimal stability for level flight[1][2][4].\n\nThe research comes as the B-21 Raider, built by Northrop Grumman, undergoes intensive flight testing at Edwards Air Force Base in California[4][5][6]. A second test aircraft joined the program in September 2025, marking what Air Force Secretary Troy Meink called \"substantial momentum\" for the sixth-generation stealth bomber[5][6][7].","audio_url":"","url":"china-finds-flaws-in-us-b-21-b-te_hNXqcQWe69BWf1pn.XA","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/1b7452c7-01ec-4a18-ac18-2022804ccdbb","published_datetime":"2026-01-07T15:05:21.555545","title":"Venezuela stocks surge on Maduro ouster, US oil deal","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/06/venezuela-bonds-are-the-hottest-trade-on-wall-street-this-week-but-risks-remain.html","name":"Venezuela bonds are the hottest trade on Wall Street this week, but ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--JTx3RhnZ--/t_limit/https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108248430-17676476452026-01-05t210851z_1141386342_rc25viabdpif_rtrmadp_0_usa-venezuela.jpeg%3Fv%3D1767647717%26w%3D1920%26h%3D1080","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--EOEK64FQ--/t_thumbnail/https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108248430-17676476452026-01-05t210851z_1141386342_rc25viabdpif_rtrmadp_0_usa-venezuela.jpeg%3Fv%3D1767647717%26w%3D1920%26h%3D1080"},"description":"Venezuela's stock market soared in the days following the January 3 capture of President Nicolás Maduro by US forces, with the Caracas Stock Exchange's IBC index surging 50% on Tuesday and adding another 16% on Monday—a combined gain of roughly 73% since the military operation[1][2][3].

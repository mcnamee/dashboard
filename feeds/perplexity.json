Dwindling water supplies, poisonous air, and crumbling infrastructure have compelled Iranians to take to the streets in the deadliest uprising the country has seen in decades.\n\nA new analysis published this week by Nima Shokri of the United Nations University reveals a pattern: protests are more likely to erupt in areas suffering from groundwater depletion, land subsidence, and water rationing. Provinces such as Tehran, Khuzestan in the southwest, and Isfahan in central Iran, all regions with high levels of protest, are grappling with acute water shortages and disputes over access.[1][2][3]","audio_url":"","url":"environmental-crisis-drives-ir-3nFIi39UQ927C7Qr76OIyg","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/edccbb9b-44d7-4d81-bb62-948946d45665","published_datetime":"2026-01-27T04:08:31.547623","title":"Startup Genyro launches to speed DNA synthesis for AI-designed biology","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.gbnews.com/science/science-breakthrough-ai-virus-bacteria","name":"Science breakthrough as biologists team up to write ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--KTSn0exQ--/t_limit/https://www.gbnews.com/media-library/science-experiement.jpg%3Fid%3D63248662%26width%3D1200%26height%3D600%26coordinates%3D0%252C47%252C0%252C287","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--AeRjx4XD--/t_thumbnail/https://www.gbnews.com/media-library/science-experiement.jpg%3Fid%3D63248662%26width%3D1200%26height%3D600%26coordinates%3D0%252C47%252C0%252C287"},"description":"A tiny virus designed by artificial intelligence and assembled in a lab is reigniting debate over how quickly biology is becoming an engineering discipline—and how prepared regulators are for that shift.\n\nThe virus is a bacteriophage, meaning it infects bacteria rather than humans.

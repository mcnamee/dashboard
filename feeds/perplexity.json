Six of eight international climate datasets ranked 2025 as the third-warmest year, while two ranked it second-warmest in the 176-year temperature record. The findings came despite the cooling influence of La Niña conditions at the start and end of the year.[1][2][3]\n\n\"The year 2025 started and ended with a cooling La Niña and yet it was still one of the warmest years on record globally because of the accumulation of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in our atmosphere,\" said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.[2][1]","audio_url":"","url":"climate-change-drives-extreme-Jz2dFQ5ST2WH6uLYJ4PZpQ","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/fe837d23-a400-4fa3-9565-9a74bb90b9bb","published_datetime":"2026-01-21T16:37:13.487525","title":"Pew report finds Catholicism declining sharply across Latin America","featured_image":{"url":"https://zenit.org/2024/10/13/pope-francis-popularity-plummets-in-the-u-s-and-6-latin-american-countries/","name":"Pope Francis' popularity plummets in the U.S. and 6 Latin ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--Oc0yitLt--/t_limit/https://zenit.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/alguna-vez-fue-una-figura-muy-popular-en-america-latina-ahora-esta-viendo-una-disminucion-en-su-favorabilidad-01.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--qxTGQqkg--/t_thumbnail/https://zenit.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/alguna-vez-fue-una-figura-muy-popular-en-america-latina-ahora-esta-viendo-una-disminucion-en-su-favorabilidad-01.jpg"},"description":"A new report from the Pew Research Center released Wednesday reveals that Catholicism continues to decline across Latin America, with the Catholic share of the population falling by at least 9 percentage points in each of six major countries surveyed over the past decade.

These six nations collectively represent about 75% of Latin America's population.[1][2]\n\n\"Our analysis found that the Catholic share of the population in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru has significantly declined since 2013-14, while a growing share of adults in the region are religiously unaffiliated,\" said Kirsten Lesage, a Pew research associate and the report's lead author.[3][4]","audio_url":"","url":"pew-reports-decline-in-christi-uP_bO.uMQtG5IJW1JlC6fw","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/ddf149a8-fa90-4b7d-8ab7-d8cc9dd706e0","published_datetime":"2026-01-21T16:23:03.046164","title":"Indonesian cave hand stencil becomes oldest dated rock art","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2512357-oldest-known-rock-art-is-a-68000-year-old-hand-stencil-with-claws/","name":"Oldest known rock art is a 68,000-year-old hand stencil with claws","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--uznxA3KI--/t_limit/https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20110140/SEI_281501994.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--XFe5Zl5T--/t_thumbnail/https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20110140/SEI_281501994.jpg"},"description":"A faded hand stencil found in a cave on Indonesia's Muna Island has been dated to at least 67,800 years ago, making it the oldest reliably dated rock art ever discovered.

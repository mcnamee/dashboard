Some reports suggest the actual toll may be far higher, with one Tehran doctor telling TIME that at least 217 deaths had been recorded across six hospitals in the capital alone[5].\n\nMedical staff at hospitals in Tehran, Rasht, and Shiraz described facilities overwhelmed by the wounded and dead. A hospital worker in Tehran told the BBC that casualties were so numerous that \"there wasn't enough space in the morgue; the bodies were placed on top of one another\"[6][7]. Another medic reported security forces firing \"direct shots to the heads of the young people, to their hearts as well\"[6][7]. BBC Persian verified that approximately 70 bodies were brought to Poursina Hospital in Rasht on Friday night, exceeding morgue capacity[7][8].","audio_url":"","url":"iran-protest-death-toll-exceed-yb.PM.8xTOSlZI49JWD3xg","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/69e83fd3-5cf0-42be-9ff8-80835d383425","published_datetime":"2026-01-11T16:11:29.889688","title":"Iran warns US bases, Israel are 'legitimate targets'","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/iran-warns-israel-us-military-and-shipping-centers-would-be-legitimate-targets-if-washington-attacks/3796222","name":"Iran warns Israel, US military and shipping centers would be ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--V0knFUEZ--/t_limit/https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2026/01/11/thumbs_b_c_2ad1953901a110db49ba74a6effb33e2.jpg%3Fv%3D121505","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--g0ou7S66--/t_thumbnail/https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2026/01/11/thumbs_b_c_2ad1953901a110db49ba74a6effb33e2.jpg%3Fv%3D121505"},"description":"Iran's parliament speaker issued a stark warning Sunday that American military bases across the Middle East and Israel would be considered \"legitimate targets\" if the United States launches strikes against the Islamic Republic, as President Donald Trump weighs military options to support anti-government protesters.\n\nMohammad Baqer Qalibaf, speaking during a heated parliamentary session broadcast on state television, told lawmakers that Tehran would not limit itself to retaliatory strikes. \"In the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centers, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets,\" he said, using Iran's term for Israel[1][2][3]. \"We do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat.\"\n\nAs Qalibaf spoke, lawmakers rushed the parliament dais chanting \"Death to America,\" marking a sharp escalation in tensions[1][4].","audio_url":"","url":"iran-warns-us-and-israel-of-re-wldX4LVOT0CCnz.HUyzhfA","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/8a40dda0-829c-4c61-bfba-6ca824f4ac8d","published_datetime":"2026-01-11T15:41:31.522343","title":"Iran leader vows economic reform as death toll tops 160","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/11/irans-pezeshkian-pledges-economic-overhaul-amid-spiralling-protests","name":"Iran's Pezeshkian pledges economic overhaul amid spiralling protests","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--FUE4ElAz--/t_limit/https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-02-05T103233Z_1828402288_RC2WQAA93ICN_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-NUCLEAR-USA-TALKS-1738787147.jpg%3Fresize%3D1920%252C1440","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--3e5_gwXD--/t_thumbnail/https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-02-05T103233Z_1828402288_RC2WQAA93ICN_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-NUCLEAR-USA-TALKS-1738787147.jpg%3Fresize%3D1920%252C1440"},"description":"Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian pledged to overhaul his country's struggling economy on Sunday while accusing the United States and Israel of orchestrating nationwide protests that have left more than 160 dead, according to multiple reports.\n\nIn a televised address, Pezeshkian struck a conciliatory tone, saying his government is \"ready to heed the voice of its people\" and is \"determined to resolve economic problems by any means possible\"[1][2][3][4][5].

The object represents a category called Reionization-Limited H I Clouds, or RELHICs—theoretical \"failed galaxies\" that never accumulated enough gas to ignite star formation[1][2][3][7][8][9].\n\n\"This is a tale of a failed galaxy,\" said Alejandro Benitez-Llambay, an astrophysicist at the University of Milano-Bicocca in Milan, Italy, who serves as the study's principal investigator[1][10][11]. The findings, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters in November 2025, were presented Monday at the conference[1][8][11].\n\nCloud-9's core spans roughly 4,900 light-years and contains about one million solar masses of neutral hydrogen gas[1][3][8]. Yet calculations suggest the cloud sits within a dark matter halo weighing approximately five billion solar masses—mass that provides gravitational structure without producing visible light[1][3][12].\n\n\"Cloud-9 gives us a rare look at a dark-matter-dominated cloud,\" said Andrew Fox, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute for the European Space Agency[1][3][13].\n\nThe discovery began three years ago when China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope detected the hydrogen cloud during a radio survey[1][2][3][4][14][15]. Subsequent observations from the Green Bank Telescope and Very Large Array confirmed the gas presence, but only Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys could definitively rule out stars[1][3][4][8][13].\n\n\"Before we used Hubble, you could argue that this is a faint dwarf galaxy that we could not see with ground-based telescopes,\" said lead author Gagandeep Anand of the Space Telescope Science Institute[3][13][12]. \"But with Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys, we're able to nail down that there's nothing there.\"","audio_url":"","url":"astronomers-discover-mysteriou-FcFCo.KQS1GhHlS0CS6RIw","partition_name":"partition1"}]}

Harvard physicist Avi Loeb continues to argue that unusual features of the comet warrant consideration of extraterrestrial origins, while NASA and mainstream astronomers maintain overwhelming evidence points to natural cometary behavior.\n\nOn December 18, the Breakthrough Listen program conducted a technosignature search of 3I/ATLAS using the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope, less than 24 hours before the object's closest approach to Earth[1][2]. The search, which scanned radio frequencies from 1 to 12 gigahertz, found no artificial signals down to a sensitivity of 100 milliwatts[2]. \"We report a nondetection of candidate signals down to the 100 mW level,\" researchers wrote in findings published this week[2].\n\nThe comet passed within approximately 168 million miles of Earth on December 19, posing no threat to our planet[3][4]. Discovered on July 1 by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile, 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object ever detected passing through our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019[3][5].","audio_url":"","url":"harvard-physicist-sparks-debat-DuJGtwupTqqIfrW1z2ZYeQ","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/7dd0461a-8729-4c3b-ba91-060adf030ca6","published_datetime":"2025-12-28T17:47:52.720317","title":"Zelenskyy to present updated 20-point peace plan in meeting with Trump","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-florida-kyiv-hopes-rcna251195","name":"As Trump and Zelenskyy meet in Florida, Kyiv hopes this time will be different","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--wVaHhYU9--/t_limit/https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630%2Cf_auto%2Cq_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250818-donald-trump-volodymyr-zelenskyy-se-432p-995bd6.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--naL8ooT5--/t_thumbnail/https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630%2Cf_auto%2Cq_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250818-donald-trump-volodymyr-zelenskyy-se-432p-995bd6.jpg"},"description":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived in Florida on Sunday to meet with President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, presenting a revised 20-point peace proposal aimed at ending nearly four years of war with Russia[1][2][3][4][5].

The rare cosmic object has exhibited unpredictable trajectory changes and unusual features that challenge standard comet models, intensifying calls for the release of raw observational data[3][4].\n\nIn late December, astronomers observed that 3I/ATLAS had deviated from its predicted path due to non-gravitational acceleration—forces not accounted for by gravity alone[3][5]. According to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, the comet experienced a \"radial acceleration away from the Sun of 1.1x10^{-6} au per day squared,\" which would require the object to have shed approximately 13 percent of its total mass during its October perihelion passage[5][6].

The system, published today in Nature Chemical Engineering, operates entirely outside living cells using enzymes designed to perform reactions never before seen in nature[1][2][3].\n\nThe breakthrough addresses a persistent challenge in carbon capture: converting simple one-carbon molecules into complex chemicals that can serve as raw materials for fuels, plastics and pharmaceuticals. While electrochemical processes can already reduce CO2 into formate—a simple liquid compound—biological systems have struggled to efficiently upgrade formate into more useful products[4][3].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/1849d750-5188-4a85-9f13-73935981c175.mp3","url":"artificial-metabolism-converts-TjFOm3..RVyyWDuqPHSILA","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/87abdbd8-3593-45e1-900b-df74293a77b6","published_datetime":"2025-12-22T20:15:41.927193","title":"China, Iran condemn U.S. tanker seizures off Venezuela","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/12/20/us-seizes-second-oil-vessel-off-venezuela-coast-officials-say","name":"US seizes second oil tanker off Venezuela’s coast","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--jU-mQnEJ--/t_limit/https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-21T004255Z_1542631356_RC2GKIAIHV2M_RTRMADP_3_USA-VENEZUELA-MILITARY-VESSEL-1766280183_676786-1766280260.jpg%3Fresize%3D1200%252C630%26quality%3D80","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--KAOnjkFa--/t_thumbnail/https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-21T004255Z_1542631356_RC2GKIAIHV2M_RTRMADP_3_USA-VENEZUELA-MILITARY-VESSEL-1766280183_676786-1766280260.jpg%3Fresize%3D1200%252C630%26quality%3D80"},"description":"China condemned U.S. seizures of oil tankers off Venezuela's coast on Monday, calling them a serious violation of international law as Iran pledged broad cooperation with Caracas in response to what both nations characterize as American aggression[1][2][3].\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular press briefing in Beijing that \"the US practice of arbitrarily seizing other countries' vessels grossly violates international law\"[1][2].

Meanwhile, observations from the James Webb Space Telescope suggest that mysterious \"little red dots\" discovered in the distant universe are actually \"black hole stars\"—supermassive black holes wrapped in dense gas envelopes that glow like giant stars—according to analysis published today in New Scientist[4].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/c8064234-4ced-4b16-9c5f-0fd78a2961fb.mp3","url":"new-simulations-and-jwst-revea-D6N1.D7VR9yRmUlP3tj4Tg","partition_name":"partition1"}]}

State news agency Xinhua reported the drills, named \"Just Mission 2025,\" will focus on naval and air force combat readiness and securing strategic ports[4][5].\n\nThe announcement comes just days after China imposed sanctions on 20 U.S. defense companies and 10 executives on December 26, retaliating against Washington's approval of an $11.1 billion arms package to Taiwan—the largest ever U.S. weapons deal with the island[6][7][8]. The sanctions targeted major contractors including Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and L3Harris, freezing their assets in China and barring dealings with them[7][8].","audio_url":"","url":"china-announces-live-fire-mili-Y3vgTrU.SDeZcP2UwKps2Q","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/a1c6ac20-558e-4c91-854d-0fd54b6db353","published_datetime":"2025-12-28T22:30:20.170711","title":"Trump, Zelenskyy say Ukraine peace plan is 90% complete","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/trump-welcomes-zelenskyy-talks-asserts-russia-ukraine-both-want-peace-however-elusive/Q5BZFCJESRB4RLDNIVUVYNJXTY/","name":"Trump welcomes Zelenskyy for talks, asserts Russia and ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--_L-Za_Yk--/t_limit/https://cmg-cmg-tv-10020-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/MMPRBVHT6I2Z3KLBVZV2IK5LW4.jpg%3Fsmart%3Dtrue%26auth%3D92c9885c871ad3d70517876d1912ef02e83d2aed842a7ef79decc673f028e36d%26width%3D2408%26height%3D1354","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--mTgdROvX--/t_thumbnail/https://cmg-cmg-tv-10020-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/MMPRBVHT6I2Z3KLBVZV2IK5LW4.jpg%3Fsmart%3Dtrue%26auth%3D92c9885c871ad3d70517876d1912ef02e83d2aed842a7ef79decc673f028e36d%26width%3D2408%26height%3D1354"},"description":"President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held high-stakes talks at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday, discussing a revised peace framework to end Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine, with Trump expressing optimism about reaching a deal despite unresolved territorial disputes.\n\nThe meeting came hours after Trump held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a move that caught Ukrainian officials off guard[1][2][3].

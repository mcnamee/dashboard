The study, published December 22 in The Astrophysical Journal, marks the first time scientists have fully modeled luminous black hole accretion using Einstein's general relativity without relying on simplified approximations[1][2][3].\n\nThe research was led by Lizhong Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study and the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Astrophysics. Using two of the world's most powerful supercomputers, Frontier at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Aurora at Argonne National Laboratory, the team calculated how matter flows into stellar mass black holes while accurately accounting for both gravity's extreme warping of spacetime and the dominant role of radiation[1][2][3].\n\n\"This is the first time we've been able to see what happens when the most important physical processes in black hole accretion are included accurately,\" Zhang said[1][2]. \"What's most exciting is that our simulations now reproduce remarkably consistent behaviors across black hole systems seen in the sky, from ultraluminous X-ray sources to X-ray binaries. In a sense, we've managed to 'observe' these systems not through a telescope, but through a computer.\"","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/21251821-428a-4012-ba60-a60e355da22b.mp3","url":"new-simulations-and-observatio-n4WLZuISQR2RwpXbKWOM2Q","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/b1e4ea11-10d9-4701-8b6c-ac7c9d2b7b37","published_datetime":"2025-12-23T11:27:52.330554","title":"Ukraine uses $1,000 drones to counter Russian attacks","featured_image":{"url":"https://ukrainesarmsmonitor.substack.com/p/sting-interceptor-drone-by-wild-hornets","name":"STING Interceptor Drone by Wild Hornets - Ukraine's Arms Monitor","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--kX9B8hzZ--/t_limit/https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/%24s_%21i66c%21%2Cw_1200%2Ch_600%2Cc_fill%2Cf_jpg%2Cq_auto:good%2Cfl_progressive:steep%2Cg_auto/https%253A%252F%252Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Ff618650a-13ac-44ff-af50-7472f0dbaa4d_1280x676.jpeg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--rfDhS_UV--/t_thumbnail/https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/%24s_%21i66c%21%2Cw_1200%2Ch_600%2Cc_fill%2Cf_jpg%2Cq_auto:good%2Cfl_progressive:steep%2Cg_auto/https%253A%252F%252Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Ff618650a-13ac-44ff-af50-7472f0dbaa4d_1280x676.jpeg"},"description":"Ukrainian forces are turning to affordable, domestically-produced drones to reshape their defense strategy, using interceptor drones costing as little as $1,000 to shoot down Russian aerial weapons and ground robots to ferry supplies across deadly frontline zones.\n\nThe shift marks a dramatic transformation in modern warfare, with Ukraine deploying systems that went from prototype to mass production in just months during 2025.

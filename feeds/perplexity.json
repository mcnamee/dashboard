Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked President Donald Trump on Wednesday to hold off on a military strike against Iran, according to senior U.S. officials, as four Arab nations conducted urgent diplomacy to avert an American attack that they feared could destabilize the region.\n\nThe request from Netanyahu came as Trump appeared to pull back from the brink of military action, telling reporters Wednesday that he had been informed by \"very, very important sources on the other side\" that the killing of protesters in Iran had stopped and planned executions would not take place.[1][2][3]","audio_url":"","url":"netanyahu-asks-trump-to-delay-ylzHUSDOTEyWjpP9mq0_IA","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/49e94822-cff2-4271-8a1b-930dda3b0219","published_datetime":"2026-01-15T16:57:45.220728","title":"Canada

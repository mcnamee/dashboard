Deutsche Bank projects AI data center capital expenditure could reach $4 trillion by 2030[1][2][3], while Morgan Stanley strategist Andrew Sheets notes that \"costs are going up not down in our forecast, because there's inflation in chip costs and inflation in power costs\"[1][2][4].\n\n\"What keeps us awake at night is that inflation risk has resurfaced,\" said Julius Bendikas, European head of economics and dynamic asset allocation at Mercer, which manages $683 billion in assets[1][2]. Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management, warned that while he continues holding tech stocks for now, he \"would not be surprised to see inflation booming worldwide by the end of 2026\"[5][2].","audio_url":"","url":"investors-shift-focus-amid-202-BU7v.4w0TFmaUZD6s9mlKQ","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/5ecc216f-8c5e-4a61-8db5-c0f436d16565","published_datetime":"2026-01-05T10:50:54.778868","title":"Markets rise as US captures Venezuelan President Maduro","featured_image":{"url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-nasdaq-futures-inch-up-after-us-moves-in-venezuela-arrest-of-maduro-235634814.html","name":"Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq futures inch up after US moves in Venezuela, arrest of Maduro","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--5DqJXPVG--/t_limit/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jTifiM7pTRI7xbwRbtMwdA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/f1bd6b30-e9c4-11f0-b76b-2da2c09c4452","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--aI_Z3Faz--/t_thumbnail/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jTifiM7pTRI7xbwRbtMwdA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/f1bd6b30-e9c4-11f0-b76b-2da2c09c4452"},"description":"Global stock markets climbed Monday as investors absorbed the dramatic weekend US military operation in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro, with traders weighing geopolitical risks against potential long-term economic opportunities[1][2][3].\n\nUS stock futures rose in early trading, with the S&P 500 gaining 0.2%, the Nasdaq 100 jumping 0.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average edging up 0.1%[1][2].

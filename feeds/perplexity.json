The object represents a category called Reionization-Limited H I Clouds, or RELHICs—theoretical \"failed galaxies\" that never accumulated enough gas to ignite star formation[1][2][3][7][8][9].\n\n\"This is a tale of a failed galaxy,\" said Alejandro Benitez-Llambay, an astrophysicist at the University of Milano-Bicocca in Milan, Italy, who serves as the study's principal investigator[1][10][11]. The findings, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters in November 2025, were presented Monday at the conference[1][8][11].\n\nCloud-9's core spans roughly 4,900 light-years and contains about one million solar masses of neutral hydrogen gas[1][3][8]. Yet calculations suggest the cloud sits within a dark matter halo weighing approximately five billion solar masses—mass that provides gravitational structure without producing visible light[1][3][12].\n\n\"Cloud-9 gives us a rare look at a dark-matter-dominated cloud,\" said Andrew Fox, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute for the European Space Agency[1][3][13].\n\nThe discovery began three years ago when China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope detected the hydrogen cloud during a radio survey[1][2][3][4][14][15]. Subsequent observations from the Green Bank Telescope and Very Large Array confirmed the gas presence, but only Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys could definitively rule out stars[1][3][4][8][13].\n\n\"Before we used Hubble, you could argue that this is a faint dwarf galaxy that we could not see with ground-based telescopes,\" said lead author Gagandeep Anand of the Space Telescope Science Institute[3][13][12]. \"But with Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys, we're able to nail down that there's nothing there.\"","audio_url":"","url":"astronomers-discover-mysteriou-FcFCo.KQS1GhHlS0CS6RIw","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/a9ae2bc4-60a2-4476-bdab-37e5a0c038db","published_datetime":"2026-01-10T14:42:15.869446","title":"Greenland parliament unites to reject Trump acquisition threats","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-must-quickly-form-broad-coalition-show-unity-face-trump-pressure-2025-03-14/","name":"Greenland's Democrats want broad coalition to show unity in face of Trump pressure","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--r78YY7ix--/t_limit/https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UZTICYNXBBLUHI4XUZIYVQG3ZE.jpg%3Fauth%3D85cab42f28b495f34e51c2519ab2715befb43d49855bf3ec52763ceb7cdd0080%26height%3D1005%26width%3D1920%26quality%3D80%26smart%3Dtrue","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--CSVlAw2h--/t_thumbnail/https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UZTICYNXBBLUHI4XUZIYVQG3ZE.jpg%3Fauth%3D85cab42f28b495f34e51c2519ab2715befb43d49855bf3ec52763ceb7cdd0080%26height%3D1005%26width%3D1920%26quality%3D80%26smart%3Dtrue"},"description":"President Donald Trump intensified his push to acquire Greenland on Friday, declaring the United States will \"do something on Greenland whether they like it or not,\" as the world's largest island becomes a flashpoint for geopolitical tensions over its vast mineral wealth and strategic Arctic position[1][2][3].\n\nAll five political parties in Greenland's parliament issued a unified rejection hours later. \"We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders,\" the leaders stated in a rare joint declaration, announcing an expedited parliamentary session to address the escalating U.S. threats[2][4].

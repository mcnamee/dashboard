The timing of Loeb's proposal came just two days after 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, passing within 168 million miles of our planet[5][6].\n\n\"Riding 3I/ATLAS offers the benefit of reaching interstellar space by the year ~10,000 CE instead of the year ~30,000 CE,\" Loeb wrote, comparing the comet's trajectory to NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft[1][4]. The Voyager probe, launched in 1977, travels at 17 kilometers per second and will require another 28,000 years to reach the assumed edge of the solar system, according to Loeb's calculations[1]. In contrast, 3I/ATLAS moves at 60 kilometers per second, cutting the journey time by more than two-thirds[1].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/404e6f31-1375-46f1-af10-d71b9d8d75b1.mp3","url":"harvard-s-loeb-calls-3iatlas-a-2DgcjYmoQLS0msGEhaO6OA","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/6fbae154-5168-454f-bf6c-780b9bae2a51","published_datetime":"2025-12-22T14:13:46.058858","title":"NBA and FIBA to launch new European basketball league in 2027","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6435965/2025/06/18/nba-europe-euroleague-tony-parker/","name":"As NBA plans for new pro league in Europe progress, EuroLeague ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--X4bj8CU8--/t_limit/https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/06/18150959/GettyImages-2206568267-scaled.jpg%3Fwidth%3D1200%26height%3D630%26fit%3Dcover","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--TkBFCX3n--/t_thumbnail/https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/06/18150959/GettyImages-2206568267-scaled.jpg%3Fwidth%3D1200%26height%3D630%26fit%3Dcover"},"description":"The NBA and world governing body FIBA will begin formally approaching European clubs and owners in January about joining a new continent-wide basketball league, with a working launch target of October 2027.[1][2][3] The project, years in the making, would create a top-tier competition backed by the NBA’s commercial machine but structured around Europe’s traditional promotion-and-qualification model.[1][4][5]\n\nAt the heart of the proposal is a hybrid format that combines guaranteed places for a core group of clubs with annual access via sporting merit.

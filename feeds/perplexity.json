The findings, released in December 2025, pose what researchers call a \"serious challenge\" to the standard model that has guided our understanding of the cosmos for nearly a century[1][3][4].\n\nSubir Sarkar, Emeritus Professor at the University of Oxford, and colleagues examined what they term the \"cosmic dipole anomaly\"—a discrepancy between variations in the cosmic microwave background radiation and the distribution of distant matter[1][2][3][6][4]. According to The Conversation, the universe fails what's known as the Ellis-Baldwin test, showing that variations in matter don't align with those in the relic radiation from the Big Bang[3][7].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/a9f9914b-c3be-41d5-9524-4e682ff368c7.mp3","url":"new-study-finds-universe-may-b-N8yJ194YQ_eLrYP8fnoRPw","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/1849d750-5188-4a85-9f13-73935981c175","published_datetime":"2025-12-22T21:11:53.186116","title":"Synthetic metabolism converts CO2 into chemical building blocks","featured_image":{"url":"https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/artificial-metabolism-turns-co2-into-valuable-chemicals","name":"Artificial metabolism converts CO2 into useful industrial ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--LwaXpMMS--/t_limit/https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2188866305-1.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--TC-M6f7A--/t_thumbnail/https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2188866305-1.jpg"},"description":"Northwestern University and Stanford University researchers have engineered a fully synthetic metabolic system that transforms carbon dioxide-derived molecules into valuable chemical building blocks, marking a step forward in carbon recycling technology. The system, published today in Nature Chemical Engineering, operates entirely outside living cells using enzymes designed to perform reactions never before seen in nature[1][2][3].\n\nThe breakthrough addresses a persistent challenge in carbon capture: converting simple one-carbon molecules into complex chemicals that can serve as raw materials for fuels, plastics and pharmaceuticals. While electrochemical processes can already reduce CO2 into formate—a simple liquid compound—biological systems have struggled to efficiently upgrade formate into more useful products[4][3].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/1849d750-5188-4a85-9f13-73935981c175.mp3","url":"artificial-metabolism-converts-TjFOm3..RVyyWDuqPHSILA","partition_name":"partition1"}]}

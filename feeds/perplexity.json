Provinces such as Tehran, Khuzestan in the southwest, and Isfahan in central Iran, all regions with high levels of protest, are grappling with acute water shortages and disputes over access.[1][2][3]","audio_url":"","url":"environmental-crisis-drives-ir-3nFIi39UQ927C7Qr76OIyg","partition_name":"partition1"}]}

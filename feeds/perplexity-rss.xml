      <title>Wall Street stumbles as European markets hit records</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/wall-street-and-global-markets-1Ozme5X8Qsm7rDSKzQAG1A</link>
      <description>Wall Street opened the first trading day of 2026 with optimism but quickly reversed course, with major U.S. indexes closing lower despite strong gains in semiconductor stocks[1][2]. European markets, meanwhile, surged to record highs as Britain's FTSE 100 crossed the symbolic 10,000-point threshold for the first time[3][4].

The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.7% to close at 6,845.50 points, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.8% to 23,241.99[5][6]. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.6% to 48,063.29, with 26 of its 30 components ending in negative territory[5]. The losses marked a fifth consecutive session in the red for the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, ending hopes for a traditional "Santa Claus rally"[1][7].

Early gains were driven by semiconductor stocks, with Micron Technology jumping nearly 8% and Intel rising approximately 7%[8][9]. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index climbed 3.4% during the session[1]. However, weakness in consumer discretionary stocks, including Amazon, which fell as Tesla shares declined 1.6% after the electric vehicle maker reported annual sales fell for a second consecutive year[1][10].</description>

      <title>Comet explosion tied to mammoth extinction, study says</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/comet-explosion-theory-gains-s-hzv492ZXSQiJ1PtEUDKCYA</link>
      <description>Scientists have uncovered what they describe as their strongest evidence yet that a fragmented comet exploded over Earth nearly 13,000 years ago, potentially triggering the extinction of mammoths, mastodons, and other Ice Age megafauna.

In a study published in PLOS One, researchers led by UC Santa Barbara Emeritus Professor of Earth Science James Kennett identified shocked quartz at three archaeological sites linked to the Clovis culture[1][2]. The microscopic sand grains, which show internal damage from extreme heat and pressure, were found at Murray Springs in Arizona, Blackwater Draw in New Mexico, and Arlington Canyon in California's Channel Islands[3][1][2].

According to the University of California - Santa Barbara, shocked quartz is considered one of the most reliable indicators of cosmic impact[1]. Using electron microscopy and cathodoluminescence, the team confirmed the quartz grains contained distinctive fractures filled with melted silica, formed under conditions far exceeding those of volcanic activity or early human fires[1][2].</description>

      <title>Maduro offers US open oil investment as economy reels</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/maduro-offers-oil-investment-d-TH79JCw.Tc.2YExM7WmuYw</link>
      <description>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro extended a rare conciliatory offer to the Trump administration on January 1, proposing US oil investments "whenever, wherever, and however they want" in a state television interview recorded on New Year's Eve. The unprecedented overture comes as Venezuela's economy buckles under an American blockade that has slashed oil production and sparked the first confirmed US strike on Venezuelan territory.

In the interview with Spanish journalist Ignacio Ramonet, Maduro declared that "if they want Venezuela's oil, Venezuela is ready to accept US investments like those of Chevron, when, where and how they want to make them," according to Reuters[1][2]. He also proposed "serious" talks on drug trafficking and migration, telling the American people that Venezuela is "a brother country" with "a friendly government"[1][3].

The softened rhetoric marks a stark departure for Maduro, who has spent recent weeks condemning what he calls US attempts to seize Venezuela's resources. The shift coincides with intensifying economic pain from President Trump's December 16 declaration of a "total and complete blockade" on sanctioned oil tankers[4][5], which has paralyzed exports and forced Venezuela to begin shutting oil wells.</description>

      <description>As the tech industry prepares to converge on Las Vegas for CES 2026 starting January 6, two critical forces are reshaping the computing landscape: an unprecedented race to build AI infrastructure and a memory chip shortage driving prices to historic highs.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and AMD CEO Lisa Su will deliver back-to-back keynotes on January 5, setting the tone for an event expected to showcase how artificial intelligence is transforming data centers, consumer devices, and the global semiconductor supply chain[1][2][3][4].</description>

      <title>Iran protests spread to 50 cities, leaving 7 dead</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/massive-anti-khamenei-protests-5VFbja9CT_OPMq5uJZgtQw</link>
      <description>Iran is confronting its most serious wave of unrest since 2022, as demonstrations that began over economic grievances have rapidly evolved into open defiance of the country's theocratic leadership. The protests, now in their sixth day, have spread to at least 50 cities and resulted in at least seven deaths in clashes with security forces[1][2][3][4][5].

What started December 28 as merchants striking over a currency crisis has transformed into a nationwide uprising. Demonstrators are chanting "Death to the dictator" and "Mullahs must leave Iran," directly targeting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei with an intensity not seen since the protests following Mahsa Amini's death in 2022[1][6][7].

The unrest reached a critical turning point when protests spread to Qom, Iran's clerical stronghold and the ideological heart of the Islamic Republic. Videos from the holy city showed demonstrators fighting back against security forces and chanting slogans calling for the clergy's removal, representing a profound symbolic blow to the regime[6][8][7].</description>

      <title>Gold surges as Trump warns Iran amid 2026 market uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/experts-predict-uncertainty-fo-keCoAev0T.a_9mLH8.4F5A</link>
      <description>As 2026 begins, investors and policymakers are confronting a landscape defined by elevated geopolitical tensions and divergent economic forecasts, with Asia caught between U.S. policy unpredictability and Middle Eastern instability that sent gold surging above $4,300 per ounce on the year's first trading day.

Escalating U.S.-Iran tensions dominated early market sentiment, with President Donald Trump issuing a "locked and loaded" warning on January 2 following massive protests in Iran sparked by inflation exceeding 42%[1]. The rhetoric rekindled fears of direct military conflict after U.S. and Israeli forces reportedly struck Iranian nuclear facilities in June 2025, pushing investors toward safe-haven assets[1]. Meanwhile, experts warn that the Middle East's "armed peace" remains fragile, with analysts at SpecialEurasia assessing that the region faces "high-probability" prospects of renewed Israeli-Iranian conflict in early 2026[2].</description>

      <title>2025 ranked among three hottest years on record</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/2025-breaks-global-and-uk-heat-9jmfwDZRTWGa2f_retn5uA</link>
      <description>Scientists confirmed Friday that 2025 was among the three hottest years ever recorded globally while the United Kingdom experienced its warmest and sunniest year since measurements began, marking a milestone in the accelerating climate crisis as the three-year temperature average exceeded the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C warming threshold for the first time[1][2][3][4][5].

The Met Office reported the UK's mean temperature reached 10.09°C in 2025, surpassing the previous record of 10.03°C set in 2022[3][4][5]. The reading makes 2025 only the second year since 1884 that the UK's annual temperature has topped 10°C, and places four of the last five years in the top five warmest on record[3][4][5]. The UK also recorded 1648.5 hours of sunshine, 61.4 hours more than the previous record set in 2003[4][6].

Globally, 2025 ranked as one of the three hottest years recorded, joining 2023 and trailing 2024, which the World Meteorological Organization confirmed in January as the warmest year at 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels[2][7][8]. More concerning to climate scientists, the three-year period from 2023 to 2025 marked the first time the running temperature average broke through the 1.5°C threshold established in the 2015 Paris Agreement[2][9][10][11].</description>

      <description>Multiple explosions rocked Venezuela's capital Caracas in the early hours of Saturday as President Trump ordered military strikes on Venezuelan military facilities, marking a dramatic escalation in Washington's pressure campaign against the Maduro regime[1][2][3].

At least seven explosions were heard around 2 a.m. local time, accompanied by low-flying aircraft and power outages in several neighborhoods, according to witnesses and international reporting[4][5][3]. The strikes targeted key military installations including Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela's largest military complex, and La Carlota Air Base in eastern Caracas[5][6][7]. Reports also indicated strikes on El Libertador Air Force Base in Maracay, a strategic hub for Venezuela's air force[6][8].</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump announced early Saturday that the United States successfully captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife following military airstrikes on Caracas, though the claim could not be independently verified as of Saturday morning.

"The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country," Trump wrote on Truth Social[1][2][3][4]. The operation was conducted "in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement," and Trump said he would hold a press conference at 11 a.m. at his Mar-a-Lago estate[1][2].</description>

      <description>US Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Saturday that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores have been indicted in the Southern District of New York on multiple charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation, and weapons offenses[1][2][3]. The announcement came hours after President Donald Trump confirmed that US forces had captured the couple following a large-scale military strike on Venezuela early Saturday morning[4][5][6].

"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts," Bondi wrote on social media[1][2][7]. The charges against Maduro include narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess such weapons against the United States[2][3][6]. While specific charges against Flores were not detailed in Bondi's statement, the attorney general thanked Trump "for having the courage to demand accountability on behalf of the American People"[7][8].</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump declared Saturday that the United States would govern Venezuela until a safe transition could be organized, marking an unprecedented assertion of American control over a sovereign nation in the Western Hemisphere following a dramatic overnight military operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro[1][2][3].

"We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition," Trump said at a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida[1][3]. "So we don't want to be involved with having somebody else get in, and we have the same situation that we had for the last long period of years."</description>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the talks achieved progress on three fronts: security guarantees, reconstruction, and "a basic framework for a real rebuilding."[1] Representatives from Canada, NATO, and over a dozen European nations participated in the high-level discussions, which Ukraine's chief negotiator Rustem Umerov described as focusing on "security and economic issues, work on framework documents, and coordination of further steps with partners."[2][3]</description>

      <description>World leaders expressed deep concern and sharp divisions over the US military operation in Venezuela on Saturday, with the United Nations and major powers condemning the strikes as a dangerous violation of international law while some regional allies celebrated the capture of President Nicolás Maduro.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he was "deeply alarmed" by the overnight operation, warning that "these developments constitute a dangerous precedent," according to his spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric[1][2]. Guterres emphasized "the importance of full respect—by all—of international law, including the UN Charter" and expressed concern that "the rules of international law have not been respected"[1][3]. Venezuela has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council[1][2].</description>

      <description>In the predawn hours of Saturday, US special forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a military strike on Caracas, a dramatic escalation that could eventually reshape North American oil markets and erode Canada's dominant position as America's top crude supplier.

President Donald Trump announced at a Mar-a-Lago press conference that Maduro and his wife were seized by Delta Force operators and flown out of Venezuela to face narco-terrorism charges in New York[1][2]. The operation, dubbed "Absolute Resolve," involved 150 aircraft and lasted approximately two hours[3].</description>

      <title>Trump defends skipping Congress briefing on Venezuela raid</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-defends-not-notifying-co-AMDy0REjR7.rDCDdZeFFOw</link>
      <description>President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended their decision to bypass congressional notification before an overnight military operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Saturday, arguing that advance warning could have jeopardized the mission due to potential leaks from Capitol Hill.

"Congress has a tendency to leak," Trump said during a Saturday press conference at Mar-a-Lago[1][2][3]. "This would not be good. If they leaked...I think maybe it would have been a very different result."

The administration's decision not to brief the so-called "Gang of Eight"—the top congressional leaders and chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate intelligence committees—before the operation has sparked sharp criticism from Democrats and some Republicans who argue it violated the War Powers Act[4][5][6]. The 1973 law requires the president to consult with Congress "in every possible instance" before introducing forces into hostilities or situations where imminent hostilities are likely[3].</description>

      <title>Caracas residents hunker down after US captures Maduro</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/venezuelans-in-caracas-hunker-yiTUfx0NS_yTQwCa2VnYdQ</link>
      <description>Hours after US forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in an overnight military strike, the streets of Caracas remained largely deserted Saturday as residents grappled with an uncertain future and Venezuelan officials demanded proof their leader was still alive.

The capital awoke to desolate streets patrolled by security forces following explosions that began around 2 a.m. local time[1][2]. Parts of southern Caracas remained without electricity after strikes targeted the Fuerte Tiuna military base and La Carlota airbase[2][3], while smoke continued billowing from the Port of La Guaira to the north[1][4]. Downtown Caracas smelled of gunpowder, according to CNN reporters[5].

President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, had been "captured and flown out of the country" following what he called a "large-scale strike"[6][7]. The operation, which Trump said was conducted with US law enforcement, marked the first such American military intervention in Latin America since the 1989 Panama invasion that ousted Manuel Noriega[1][3].</description>

      <title>UK and France strike ISIS weapons site in Syria</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/uk-and-france-conduct-joint-ai-DRDRGr.IQM.dWTUJWkMI7g</link>
      <description>British and French air forces launched a coordinated strike Saturday evening on a suspected ISIS weapons facility in the mountains north of Palmyra, Syria, marking the latest Western operation to prevent the terror group's resurgence in the region[1][2][3][4][5].

RAF Typhoon FGR4 jets, supported by a Voyager refueling tanker, joined French aircraft in targeting multiple access tunnels leading to an underground site believed to store weapons and explosives[1][3][6][7]. The operation used Paveway IV guided bombs, with initial assessments indicating successful engagement of the target[1][2][8][7]. Britain's Ministry of Defence confirmed all aircraft returned safely and that the remote location was devoid of civilian habitation[1][3][8][7][9].

"This action shows our UK leadership, and determination to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies, to stamp out any resurgence of Daesh and their dangerous and violent ideologies in the Middle East," British Defence Secretary John Healey said, using an alternative name for ISIS[1][4][5][9].</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/venezuelans-worldwide-celebrat-DSvJoqXzQNCsJ0O6JC4T0g</link>
      <description>Venezuelans across the globe erupted in jubilation Saturday after US forces captured President Nicolás Maduro in a predawn military operation, ending his authoritarian rule that prompted one of the world's largest migration crises in recent history.

In the early hours of January 3, the United States launched "Operation Absolute Resolve," a massive strike involving more than 150 aircraft that disabled Venezuela's air defenses and extracted Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, from the presidential compound in Caracas[1][2]. President Donald Trump announced at a Mar-a-Lago press conference that Maduro had been "captured and flown out of the country" and would face drug trafficking charges in New York[1][3].</description>

      <title>Venezuelan VP rejects Trump claim, demands Maduro release</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/venezuelan-vp-rodriguez-defies-Nj721C0FT16NHB40R_LqmA</link>
      <description>Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez publicly rejected President Trump's assertion that she had assumed power as interim president following the U.S. capture of Nicolás Maduro, instead demanding the authoritarian leader's release in a televised address that underscored the immediate obstacles facing Washington's efforts to govern the South American nation[1][2][3].

In a Saturday morning press conference at Mar-a-Lago, Trump claimed that Rodríguez "was just sworn in as president" and had told Secretary of State Marco Rubio she was "essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again"[4][5]. Within hours, however, Rodríguez appeared on Venezuelan state television flanked by the country's National Defense Council—including the defense minister, attorney general, and legislative and judicial leaders—to denounce the U.S. military operation as "an aggression, a military aggression unprecedented against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela"[6][7].</description>

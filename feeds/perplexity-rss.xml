      <title>Dollar recovers from four-year low as traders await Fed decision</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/dollar-recovers-after-four-yea-1VOr.hIPS6.Ey_F_7ZFeGQ</link>
      <description>The U.S. dollar clawed back some ground on Wednesday after tumbling to a four-year low, as markets turned their attention to the Federal Reserve's first policy decision of 2026.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump's casual dismissal of the currency's recent slide triggered the sharpest single-day drop in the greenback since the tariff upheaval in April. When asked Tuesday whether the dollar had declined too much, Trump told reporters in Iowa, "No, I think it's great," adding that it should "just seek its own level." Traders interpreted the remarks as a green light to sell the U.S. currency aggressively.</description>

      <title>Musk eyes June planetary alignment for record SpaceX IPO</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/musk-plans-spacex-ipo-for-june-uzxPRo4MRgColT0nhVCnag</link>
      <description>Elon Musk has proposed timing SpaceX's potential initial public offering to coincide with a rare planetary alignment in mid-June, according to the Financial Times. The rocket maker is targeting a $1.5 trillion valuation and aims to raise up to $50 billion, which would make it the largest IPO in history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company is eyeing mid-June when Jupiter and Venus will appear very close together in the sky for the first time in more than three years, five people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times. On June 8 and 9, the two planets will be positioned within roughly 1.6 degrees of each other, about the width of a thumb held at arm's length, according to the nonprofit Planetary Society. Musk's 55th birthday on June 28 was also a factor in the timing decision, sources said.</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/china-solar-and-wind-capacity-EHntyMxJR.yccrBWoBxeSw</link>
      <description>China installed a record 315 gigawatts of new solar capacity in 2025 alongside 119 gigawatts of wind power, pushing combined wind and solar capacity past coal-based thermal generation for the first time in the nation's history, according to official data released by the National Energy Administration on January 28.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The figures mark a structural shift in the energy mix of the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. By the end of December, China's cumulative wind and solar capacity reached 1.84 terawatts, exceeding thermal power by 300 million kilowatts and accounting for 47.3 percent of the country's total installed power generation capacity.</description>

      <title>Trump warns Iran 'time is running out' as US naval fleet approaches</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-warns-iran-time-running-rkEJZHQeRcuuhVG7KmsENQ</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump issued an urgent ultimatum to Iran on Wednesday, warning that "time is running out" to negotiate a nuclear agreement as a massive US naval fleet approaches the region. The warning escalates tensions weeks after deadly protests rocked Iran and following last year's US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Hopefully Iran will quickly 'come to the table' and negotiate a fair and equitable deal — NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS — one that is good for all parties," Trump wrote in a social media post, according to Reuters. "Time is running out, it is truly of the essence!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump explicitly referenced the previous US military strikes on Iran, warning that "the next attack will be far worse" if Tehran does not comply. The president also noted that a "huge armada is making its way to Iran with great speed and power" and would "fulfill its mission with speed and violence if necessary".</description>

      <description>A leaked document has revealed that President Donald Trump's newly established Board of Peace would grant him extraordinary authority over Gaza's governance, reconstruction, and legal framework, drawing sharp criticism from humanitarian leaders and sparking divisions among U.S. allies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The unsigned draft resolution, dated January 22 and obtained by Drop Site News from three independent sources, shows that Trump would serve as chairman with power to sign all resolutions into force, approve military commanders, and appoint key officials throughout the governing apparatus. The document states the Board would hold "all transitional legislative and executive authority, emergency powers, and the administration of justice" over Gaza.</description>

      <description>The Bank of Canada on Wednesday maintained its benchmark interest rate at 2.25 percent, while the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep its policy rate unchanged in the 3.5-3.75 percent range when it announces its decision later today. Both central banks are navigating elevated uncertainty, with Governor Tiff Macklem warning that threats to the Fed's independence add to global economic instability.</description>

      <title>Fast-growing trees threaten forest diversity worldwide, study finds</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/fast-growing-trees-threaten-fo-68x8sfWkT3S4p3f_KysSyA</link>
      <description>The world's forests are undergoing a transformation that may weaken their ecological integrity for decades to come. A comprehensive international study published January 27 in Nature Plants warns that fast-growing tree species are increasingly dominating forest ecosystems worldwide, displacing slower-growing native trees and reducing both biodiversity and long-term carbon storage capacity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research team analyzed more than 31,000 tree species globally and found that forests are becoming homogenized as fast-growing varieties such as acacia, eucalyptus, poplar, and pine outcompete specialized native species. Nearly 41 percent of naturalized tree species—those that have established wild populations outside their native ranges—possess traits like rapid growth and small leaves that make them well-suited to disturbed environments but unable to fulfill the ecological roles of the species they replace.</description>

      <description>The Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced it will leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 3.5%-3.75%, marking a pause after three consecutive quarter-point cuts late last year. The widely anticipated decision comes as Chair Jerome Powell navigates unprecedented political pressure from President Donald Trump and a Justice Department investigation that Powell has called a "pretext" for influencing monetary policy.</description>

      <title>Mexico suspends oil shipments to Cuba amid US pressure</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/mexico-halts-oil-shipments-to-n5z8EzJcTH6tbCuudh9KKw</link>
      <description>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum confirmed Tuesday that her government has at least temporarily suspended oil shipments to Cuba, a move that comes as the Trump administration intensifies efforts to economically isolate the Caribbean island nation. While Sheinbaum insisted the decision was "sovereign" and not made under pressure from the United States, the timing follows weeks of escalating American rhetoric demanding an end to Cuba's energy lifelines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;State oil company Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) was scheduled to send a crude shipment aboard the vessel Swift Galaxy in mid-January but removed the cargo from its schedule without explanation, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. The cancellation leaves Cuba facing deepening fuel shortages and extended blackouts, with the island already producing only half the electricity it needs.</description>

      <description>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned Wednesday that the weakening dollar has become a "considerable additional burden" for Germany's export-oriented economy, while calling on Washington to uphold trade commitments made with the European Union last year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We will have to assert ourselves globally against a weak dollar and a strong euro," Merz told reporters in Berlin. "We simply have to become more competitive and stronger, especially given the currency exchange rates."</description>

      <description>Meta Platforms, Inc. will announce its fourth-quarter 2025 earnings after market close Wednesday as Wall Street scrutinizes the social media giant's aggressive artificial intelligence spending and recent workforce cuts in its virtual reality division.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect the company to report revenue of approximately $58.4 billion, a 21% year-over-year increase, with earnings per share of around $8.16 to $8.21. Bank of America analysts project the company could beat consensus estimates, forecasting revenue of $59.2 billion and EPS of $8.27.</description>

      <description>Microsoft reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results on Wednesday, but its shares fell more than 7% in extended trading as investors questioned whether the tech giant's cloud growth justifies the scale of its artificial intelligence investments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company posted fiscal second-quarter revenue of $81.3 billion, up 17% year-over-year and slightly above the $80.3 billion analysts had expected. Earnings per share of $5.16 also beat Wall Street estimates of $3.92. Azure, the cloud computing division closely watched by investors, grew 39%—narrowly edging past the 38.8% consensus estimate.</description>

      <description>A Dutch court on Wednesday ruled that the Netherlands violated the human rights of residents on the Caribbean island of Bonaire by failing to protect them from climate change, ordering the government to set binding emission reduction targets within 18 months and implement a comprehensive adaptation plan by 2030.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Hague District Court found that the Dutch state discriminated against Bonaire's approximately 20,000 residents by not devising timely climate protections for the low-lying island, which faces rising sea levels, extreme weather, and coral reef degradation.</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-warns-iraq-against-retur-Oo_itsTDSD.SOJijnmt7MA</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump warned Iraq on Tuesday that the United States will end support for the country if former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki returns to power, threatening to restrict Iraq's access to its oil revenues held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Last time Maliki was in power, the Country descended into poverty and total chaos. That should not be allowed to happen again," Trump wrote on Truth Social. "Because of his insane policies and ideologies, if elected, the United States of America will no longer help Iraq and, if we are not there to help, Iraq has ZERO chance of Success, Prosperity, or Freedom. MAKE IRAQ GREAT AGAIN!".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Al-Maliki, 75, rejected the warning on Wednesday, vowing to continue his bid for the premiership. "We categorically reject the blatant American interference in Iraq's internal affairs," he wrote on X, calling Trump's remarks "a violation of sovereignty and a contravention of the democratic order in Iraq since 2003".</description>

The Fremont, California factory lines that currently build those vehicles will be converted to manufacture Optimus humanoid robots, with a target capacity of one million units annually.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It's time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we're really moving into a future that is based on autonomy," Musk said during the call, according to TechCrunch. "If you're interested in buying a Model S and X, now would be the time to order it."</description>

      <description>A 60-meter-wide asteroid discovered just over a year ago carries a small but notable chance of striking the moon in late 2032, and researchers worldwide are preparing for what could be the most energetic lunar impact ever recorded in human history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asteroid 2024 YR4, which was first detected on December 27, 2024, at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System telescope in Chile, has approximately a 4% probability of colliding with the moon on December 22, 2032. While that means there is a 96% chance the asteroid will miss, scientists are treating the possibility as both a potential hazard and a rare scientific opportunity.</description>

      <description>Gold prices vaulted past $5,400 per ounce on Wednesday, extending an explosive rally that has seen the precious metal gain more than 25% since the start of the year, as investors sought refuge from mounting geopolitical risks and a weakening dollar ahead of the Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The yellow metal climbed as much as 4% during the session, with spot gold reaching $5,393.19 an ounce and U.S. gold futures for February settling 4.3% higher at $5,303.60, according to Reuters.

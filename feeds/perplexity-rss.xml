      <title>Markets rise as US captures Venezuelan President Maduro</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/markets-rise-after-us-captures-129XXryCQa6Yjla1zjv_dg</link>
      <description>Global stock markets climbed Monday as investors absorbed the dramatic weekend US military operation in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro, with traders weighing geopolitical risks against potential long-term economic opportunities[1][2][3].

US stock futures rose in early trading, with the S&amp;P 500 gaining 0.2%, the Nasdaq 100 jumping 0.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average edging up 0.1%[1][2]. European markets also advanced, with London's FTSE 100 rising 0.2%, Germany's DAX climbing 1%, and France's CAC 40 up 0.6%[3].

The subdued market reaction reflected analysts' assessment that Venezuela's limited oil production—currently below 1 million barrels per day, or less than 1% of global supply—constrains the potential for major disruptions[1][3][4]. "Venezuela accounts for less than 1% of global oil, and at best a political outcome restoring production will take years," said Lale Akoner, a global market analyst at eToro[3].

Gold prices surged 2.3% to $4,433.71 per ounce as investors sought safe-haven assets amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty[3][5][6]. Meanwhile, oil futures fluctuated in early trading, with Brent crude falling 0.4% to $60.60 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate declining 0.5% to $56.97[3][7].</description>

      <title>Investors shift to value stocks amid AI inflation fears</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/investors-shift-focus-amid-202-BU7v.4w0TFmaUZD6s9mlKQ</link>
      <description>As global stock markets enter 2026 riding high on artificial intelligence enthusiasm, a growing chorus of investors and strategists warn that surging AI-related spending could reignite inflation and derail the rally, prompting a strategic shift toward undervalued assets.

Money managers are increasingly concerned that the multi-trillion-dollar race among tech giants Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet to build AI data centers is driving up costs for chips and energy, creating inflationary pressures that markets may be underestimating. Deutsche Bank projects AI data center capital expenditure could reach $4 trillion by 2030[1][2][3], while Morgan Stanley strategist Andrew Sheets notes that "costs are going up not down in our forecast, because there's inflation in chip costs and inflation in power costs"[1][2][4].

"What keeps us awake at night is that inflation risk has resurfaced," said Julius Bendikas, European head of economics and dynamic asset allocation at Mercer, which manages $683 billion in assets[1][2]. Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management, warned that while he continues holding tech stocks for now, he "would not be surprised to see inflation booming worldwide by the end of 2026"[5][2].</description>

      <title>Scientists track single sunspot for record 94 days</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/solar-orbiter-sets-record-with-H1iK_OvrQBqcc8D9ER6vAA</link>
      <description>Scientists have achieved the longest continuous observation of a single active solar region, tracking sunspot NOAA 13664 for 94 days as it evolved from birth to decay. The research, published this week in the journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, offers insights into solar storm formation that could improve space weather forecasting[1][2][3].

An international team led by ETH Zurich combined data from the European Space Agency's Solar Orbiter and NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory to monitor the region from April 16 to July 18, 2024. "This is the longest continuous series of images ever created for a single active region: it's a milestone in solar physics," said Ioannis Kontogiannis, a physicist at ETH Zurich and Istituto ricerche solari Aldo e Cele Daccò in Locarno[2][3].</description>

      <description>Bitcoin climbed above $92,000 on Monday, signaling a potential shift in momentum as cryptocurrency markets shake off a difficult end to 2025 with renewed institutional interest and a surge in large-holder activity.

The world's largest cryptocurrency rose as much as 2.3% to $93,323 in early Asian trading, its highest level in three weeks, according to Bloomberg[1]. The rally pushed the total cryptocurrency market capitalization back above $3 trillion[2][3], marking a sharp reversal from the fourth quarter sell-off that saw Bitcoin fall roughly 35% from its October peak above $126,000[4][2].</description>

      <title>Netanyahu vows to block Iran's missile program rebuild</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/netanyahu-vows-israel-will-not-FbrYTuqiTcWg3HhZLGb_og</link>
      <description>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared Monday that Israel will not permit Iran to rebuild its ballistic missile industry, stating he and President Donald Trump are aligned on preventing Tehran from reconstituting weapons programs damaged during last year's conflict[1][1].

Speaking during a Knesset debate, Netanyahu said he and Trump "will not allow Iran to rebuild its ballistic missile industry, and we certainly won't let it renew its nuclear program," emphasizing their shared position that Iran must have zero enrichment capability[1][1]. The statement follows Netanyahu's late December meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, where the two leaders discussed the possibility of launching additional strikes on Iran in 2026[2][3].</description>

      <description>Nationwide demonstrations in Iran have entered a ninth consecutive day, with at least 20 protesters killed and nearly 1,000 arrested as what began as economic grievances has evolved into broader calls for regime change.

Unrest has been recorded at 222 locations across 78 cities in 26 provinces, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency[1][2][3]. The protests, initially sparked by Tehran bazaar merchants on December 28, have spread to universities and provincial cities, with demonstrators chanting "Death to the Dictator" and "Death to Khamenei"[4][5]. Security forces have responded with live ammunition, tear gas, and mass arrests, marking the largest demonstrations since the 2022 protests following Mahsa Amini's death[6][7].</description>

      <title>Trump sets two-month timeline for Greenland as Denmark warns of NATO collapse</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-threatens-greenland-anne-QYrJ7VuPRgetT_eYY72UBA</link>
      <description>US President Donald Trump escalated threats to seize Greenland on Sunday, telling reporters aboard Air Force One that America "needs" the Danish territory for national security and setting a timeline of roughly two months to address the issue[1][2][3]. The declaration followed a military operation in Venezuela that captured President Nicolás Maduro, raising alarm that Greenland could be Trump's next target[4][5].

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen delivered her strongest rebuke yet, stating that "it makes absolutely no sense to talk about the need for the United States to take over Greenland"[1][2]. According to Bloomberg, she warned that a US attack on the NATO ally would spell the end of the alliance itself[6]. "The US has no right to annex any of the three nations in the Danish kingdom," Frederiksen said, urging Washington to "stop the threats against a historically close ally"[7][8].</description>

      <title>Galaxy cluster burns five times hotter than predicted</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/astronomers-discover-unexpecte-Wc_5xRMQSzK1wDO2URtVSQ</link>
      <description>Astronomers have discovered a galaxy cluster blazing with gas at least five times hotter than predicted, just 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang, challenging fundamental assumptions about how these colossal cosmic structures form and evolve[1][2][3].

The finding, published in Nature on January 4, describes a cluster named SPT2349-56 whose gas temperatures exceed 10 million Kelvin—hotter and more energetic than many present-day galaxy clusters[1][2][4]. The discovery suggests that the birth of galaxy clusters is far more explosive than cosmologists previously believed, potentially requiring a rethink of galaxy cluster formation models[2][3].</description>

      <title>Dollar hits two-week high after Maduro's capture</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/us-arrests-maduro-markets-reac-FGxtZzUWTgWI1mi7XdLhhg</link>
      <description>Financial markets displayed a measured reaction Monday as Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro arrived at a Manhattan federal courthouse to face drug trafficking charges, following his weekend capture by US special forces. The dollar strengthened to its highest level in two weeks while oil prices remained surprisingly stable, defying expectations of significant market turbulence.

The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index climbed 0.3% to reach its strongest level since December 22, as the greenback outperformed nearly all major currencies[1][2]. The Mexican peso declined 0.7%, and the euro dropped 0.3%[2]. However, the overall market response suggested investors were treating the geopolitical shock as a contained event rather than a systemic crisis.</description>

      <title>Maduro pleads not guilty in Manhattan court to narco-terrorism charges</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/maduro-pleads-not-guilty-in-ma-ooztd.n.R9eEWfpjzZAxdw</link>
      <description>Deposed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores pleaded not guilty Monday to federal narco-terrorism and drug trafficking charges in their first court appearance since being captured by US forces two days earlier in Caracas.

"I am innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent president of my country," Maduro declared when 92-year-old US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein asked for his plea during the noon hearing at Manhattan federal court[1][2]. The judge then interrupted him, stating, "A not guilty plea will be entered on behalf of Mr. Maduro."[1]

The couple faces charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, and possession of machine guns and destructive devices[3][1]. If convicted, they could face life imprisonment[3][4]. Maduro has retained Barry Pollack, the Washington, DC-based attorney who secured WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's release in 2024[3][5]. Flores is represented by Texas lawyer Mark Donnelly[6].</description>

      <description>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum firmly downplayed threats of U.S. military intervention in Mexico on Monday, following President Donald Trump's warnings that Washington might act against drug cartels operating south of the border. The dispute marks the latest escalation between the two leaders after Trump's weekend military operation captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

"I don't believe in an invasion; I don't think it's something they take seriously," Sheinbaum said during her first press conference since U.S. forces seized Maduro early Saturday morning[1][2]. The Mexican leader emphasized her rejection of any U.S. military presence in her country, stating that Mexico is collaborating with Washington on security but will not accept intervention[1][2][3].</description>

      <title>AI capabilities doubling every 8 months, UK safety institute finds</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/experts-warn-world-unprepared-pE5Ys7SESZWgez8HB5iJYg</link>
      <description>A leading AI safety researcher has cautioned that rapid advances in artificial intelligence may outpace humanity's ability to implement adequate safeguards, warning that society could be "sleepwalking" into an era where machines control critical infrastructure before proper oversight is established.

David Dalrymple, a program director at the UK's Advanced Research and Invention Agency, told The Guardian that the world "may not have time" to prepare for safety risks posed by cutting-edge AI systems[1][2][3][4]. His warnings come as new data from Britain's AI Security Institute reveals that AI capabilities are advancing at an exponential pace, with performance in certain domains doubling every eight months[5][6][7].</description>

      <description>Astronomers have discovered that the universe's most massive galaxies followed strikingly different evolutionary paths in their infancy, with some shutting down star formation early while others remained vigorously active but cloaked in dust.

The findings, presented today at the 247th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Phoenix, reveal that ultramassive galaxies containing more than 100 billion stars exhibited diverse behaviors less than 2 billion years after the Big Bang[1][2]. The research challenges assumptions that galaxy evolution proceeded uniformly in the early universe.

"What is striking is not just that we can detect hidden activity, but that we see such diversity among galaxies with similar masses at the same epoch," said Gillian Wilson, vice chancellor for research at UC Merced and professor of physics, who mentored the study[1]. "That tells us that the shutdown of star formation in the most massive galaxies was neither uniform nor simple."</description>

      <title>Intel and AMD unveil competing AI laptop chips at CES</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/intel-and-amd-launch-new-chips-99b3fWTUS.ab5hN3FlZrkA</link>
      <description>Intel and Advanced Micro Devices unveiled competing laptop processors at CES 2026 in Las Vegas on Monday, as both chipmakers push to capture market share in the AI-powered PC market with new technologies designed to boost performance and efficiency.

Intel officially launched its Panther Lake processors, branded as Intel Core Ultra Series 3, marking the first high-volume production chips built on the company's new 18A manufacturing process[1][2][3]. The stakes are high for Intel, which has struggled with yields and lost market share to AMD in recent years[1]. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the company delivered on its promise to ship products with 18A in 2025[1].

Intel claims the new chips deliver 60% better multithread performance than its previous Lunar Lake Series 2 processors[1][2]. The flagship feature is the new Arc B390 integrated graphics chip, which Intel says offers up to 77% faster gaming performance than Lunar Lake and can match Nvidia's discrete RTX 4050 mobile GPU[1][4]. Pre-orders for laptops with the new processors begin January 6, with systems shipping globally starting January 27[3][5].</description>

      <description>The world's leading technology companies converged on Las Vegas Monday to showcase groundbreaking artificial intelligence innovations at the Consumer Electronics Show, with Nvidia, Hyundai, and Intel each debuting major new products aimed at advancing AI capabilities across data centers, factories, and personal computers.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang opened CES with the announcement of the Vera Rubin AI platform, the company's next-generation chip architecture that promises to deliver five times the artificial intelligence inference performance and 3.5 times the training performance of its current Blackwell chips[1][2][3][4]. The platform, comprising six integrated chips including the Rubin GPU with 336 billion transistors and 288GB of HBM4 memory, is expected to become available through partners in the second half of 2026[1][2][4].

"The timing of Rubin's launch is perfect, as the demand for AI computing, both for training and inference, is skyrocketing," Huang said during his keynote[2]. The announcement comes as Nvidia faces intensifying competition from rivals including Advanced Micro Devices and customers like Alphabet's Google developing their own AI chips[5].</description>

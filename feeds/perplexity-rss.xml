The unrest, now in its third consecutive day, prompted the government to suspend official work in 21 of the country's 31 provinces[2] and offer a 20-point economic plan[6] in a notable departure from the regime's typically harsh response to dissent.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Harvard physicist says interstellar object may be alien tech</title>

Observations captured on December 12 and 27 show two distinct jets of material streaming from the object's nucleus, with one pointing toward the Sun and a weaker jet extending in the opposite direction[1][2][3]. As one jet brightens, the other fades in what Loeb describes as a "clean, repeatable and geometrically consistent swap"[4].

Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist who leads the Galileo Project, has ranked 3I/ATLAS a "four" on his personal scale of zero to ten, where zero represents a natural comet and ten signifies an active alien threat[5][6]. "You can't just say, 'I know the answer' and ignore the anomalies. That's not viable," Loeb said[5][6].

3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, is only the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019[7][8]. The object passed Earth on December 19 at a safe distance of roughly 170 million miles and is now heading toward Jupiter, where it will make its closest approach on March 16, 2026[5][9].</p>]]></description>

Gold climbed more than 64% this year to trade around $4,330 per ounce on Tuesday, marking its largest annual gain since 1979, when the Iranian revolution sent prices soaring[1][2][3]. Copper notched a 41% rise on the London Metal Exchange, its best performance since 2009[4][5], as electrification and artificial intelligence infrastructure drove demand to record levels.</p>]]></description>

The MSCI All Country World Index, tracking over 2,500 stocks across developed and emerging markets, rose more than 21% through late December to reach record highs[1][2]. Even more striking, the MSCI ACWI Ex-US index achieved its best performance since the 2009 global financial crisis, climbing approximately 30% as investors diversified away from concentrated U.S. positions[3][4]. By comparison, the S&P 500 gained 18.7% for the year, marking its third consecutive annual advance[5][6].

South Korea's KOSPI index led all major global markets with a stunning 75.6% gain, its strongest annual performance since 1999[7][8]. The rally was powered by semiconductor manufacturers SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics, whose shares surged approximately 280% and 125% respectively on surging demand for high-bandwidth memory chips used in AI systems[7][9].

Latin America emerged as an unexpected star, with Colombia's equity market skyrocketing over 91% to claim the top spot globally, according to data compiled by Morningstar for CNBC[1]. Chile, Peru, Mexico, and Brazil all posted gains exceeding 45%, establishing the region as a standout performer[1]. Analysts attributed Colombia's rally to low initial valuations, improving investor sentiment ahead of presidential elections, and a Colombian peso that appreciated nearly 15% against the dollar[1].</p>]]></description>

The protests began Sunday when merchants in Tehran's Grand Bazaar shuttered their shops after the rial plunged to approximately 1.42 million against the U.S. dollar, compared to 820,000 a year earlier[1][2]. By Monday, strikes had spread beyond the capital to Isfahan, Shiraz, Kermanshah, Yazd, Zanjan, and Hamadan, with security forces deploying tear gas and, according to unverified reports, live ammunition to disperse crowds[4][5][6].

University students joined the demonstrations Tuesday, with protests reported at more than ten campuses nationwide[1][3][7]. Videos circulating on social media showed students chanting "Death to the dictator," referring to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, while others tore down signs representing his office at Beheshti University[2][7][8]. The Guild Council of the University of Tehran said six students were detained but later released[4].</p>]]></description>

The Finnish Border Guard intercepted the cargo ship Fitburg after telecoms provider Elisa detected a fault in one of its submarine cables early Wednesday morning[1][2]. The vessel, which departed Saint Petersburg on December 30 and was en route to Israel, was found operating with its anchor chain deployed in Finland's exclusive economic zone[1][2]. The actual damage to the cables occurred in Estonia's economic zone[1][3][2].

"Finland is prepared for a range of security challenges and will respond as required," President Alexander Stubb said in a statement on social media[1]. Prime Minister Petteri Orpo confirmed that state agencies are working together to determine the cause and extent of the damage[1].

The Fitburg, flying the flag of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, was ordered to raise its anchor and proceed to Finnish territorial waters where it remains under state control[1]. Helsinki Police Department is investigating the incident as aggravated criminal damage, attempted aggravated criminal damage, and aggravated interference with telecommunications[1][3][2]. The inquiry is being conducted in cooperation with Finnish Defence Forces, Customs, and Estonian authorities[1].</p>]]></description>

The Russian assault on Odesa damaged four apartment buildings and struck two energy facilities operated by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private power company, leaving parts of the city without electricity, water, and heating amid freezing temperatures[1][2][3][4]. Among the wounded were three children—ages seven months, eight, and 14—while a 42-year-old man remained in serious condition[5][2][6]. Firefighters rescued eight people from burning buildings as flames engulfed residential structures[4][7].

"Another proof that Russia is targeting civilians," Serhii Lysak, head of Odesa City Military Administration, wrote on social media[7]. The Ukrainian Energy Ministry reported that emergency repair work was underway, though restoration efforts have been hampered by the extent of damage to critical infrastructure[8][9][10].</p>]]></description>

The remarks came one day after China's People's Liberation Army announced it had "successfully completed" Justice Mission 2025, a two-day military exercise that encircled Taiwan with warships, fighter jets, and missile forces[1][2][4]. Senior Captain Li Xi, spokesperson for the PLA's Eastern Theater Command, said the drills "fully tested the integrated joint operations capabilities" of Chinese troops[1][4].</p>]]></description>

Gold climbed approximately 66% this year, while silver surged over 150%, according to multiple market sources[1][2][3][4]. Both metals are heading for their strongest yearly performance since 1979, when the Iranian Revolution and runaway inflation drove gold up 126%[1][5][6][7].

The year-end rally turned turbulent in late December when CME Group raised margin requirements on precious metals futures twice within a week[8][9][10]. The exchange cited "market volatility to ensure adequate collateral coverage" as silver broke above $80 per ounce for the first time and gold approached $4,550[8][11]. Silver margins jumped approximately 30%, while gold requirements rose roughly 9%, forcing traders to post additional cash during one of the year's thinnest trading periods[12][10].

Silver plunged nearly 9% on Monday, December 29, to just above $73 per ounce after briefly exceeding $84 over the weekend[13]. Gold dropped more than 4% to around $4,355[13]. Both metals staged recoveries on Tuesday before falling again Wednesday, with silver declining more than 8% and gold slipping approximately 0.75%[13][14].</p>]]></description>

Malaysia's Transport Ministry confirmed that the Armada 86 05 reached a designated search area with two autonomous underwater vehicles, reviving hopes of finally locating the Boeing 777 that vanished with 239 people on board on March 8, 2014[1][2][4]. The ministry did not disclose the exact location of the search zone, but stated the vessel prepared for operations at Fremantle Port in Western Australia[1][2].</p>]]></description>

Developed by Shanghai Electric Nuclear Power Group, the machine was delivered to Zhejiang University on December 22 and is currently being installed at the university's underground research facility in Hangzhou[1][2].

Once operational, CHIEF1900 will surpass all existing hypergravity centrifuges worldwide, including its predecessor CHIEF1300, which began operations in September with a capacity of 1,300 gravity-tonnes[1][3]. The previous world record was held by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers facility in Vicksburg, Mississippi, with a capacity of approximately 1,200 gravity-tonnes[1][4].</p>]]></description>

The editorial, titled "Putin 'attack' bluster shows Russia is the one standing in the way of peace," was posted to Trump's Truth Social account without additional comment[3][2].

The public rebuke came hours before Putin delivered his annual New Year's address vowing victory in Ukraine, telling troops "we believe in you and our victory"[4][5]. The dueling messages highlighted the difficulties facing U.S.-led efforts to broker an end to the nearly four-year conflict, despite Trump's recent optimism that a deal may be within reach.</p>]]></description>

The talks, which included U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Ukraine's chief negotiator Rustem Umerov, focused on strengthening security guarantees, developing deconfliction mechanisms, and advancing a "prosperity package" for Ukraine's post-war recovery[1][2][4]. French President Emmanuel Macron announced that many European states and allies will make concrete commitments to protect Ukraine at a meeting in Paris on January 6[5][5].

"We focused on how to move the discussions forward in a practical way on behalf of @POTUS' peace process, including strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart," Witkoff wrote on social media[2][4].</p>]]></description>

The Artemis II mission is scheduled to launch no earlier than February 5, 2026, with launch windows open through the end of April, according to NASA officials[1][2][3]. The 10-day mission will send four astronauts—NASA's Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, along with Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen—on a lunar flyby[4][5]. The crew will become the first people to travel beyond low-Earth orbit since Apollo 17 in December 1972[1][4]. Glover will be the first Black man, Koch the first woman, and Hansen the first non-American to venture this far from Earth[6].</p>]]></description>

      <title>US says Ukraine did not target Putin in drone strike</title>

The assessment, backed by the Central Intelligence Agency, found no evidence Ukraine aimed at Putin in the alleged December 28-29 incident, according to a U.S. official familiar with the intelligence[1][2][3]. The finding was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday[4][5].

Russia claimed on Monday that Ukraine launched 91 long-range attack drones at Putin's Valdai residence in the Novgorod region, calling it a "terrorist attack"[6][7][8]. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said all drones were intercepted and warned Moscow would revise its negotiating position[7][9][8]. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy swiftly dismissed the allegations as "another lie" intended to sabotage diplomatic progress[9][10].</p>]]></description>

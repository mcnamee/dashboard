      <title>Oceans set heat record in 2025 for ninth straight year</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/oceans-absorbed-record-heat-in-47VXWjTkTQaAGSz8NhyJ6A</link>
      <description>Earth's oceans absorbed a record-breaking amount of heat in 2025, marking the ninth consecutive year of unprecedented warming and intensifying concerns about extreme weather, rising seas, and collapsing marine ecosystems, according to research published Friday by an international team of scientists.

The upper 2,000 meters of the world's oceans absorbed 23 zettajoules more energy than in 2024—an amount equivalent to roughly 37 years of global energy consumption—according to the study in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences[1][2][3][4][5]. The research involved more than 50 scientists from 31 institutions across three continents[3][4].

"Every year, we are witnessing an increase in global temperatures—setting new records has become a recurring theme," said Prof. John Abraham from the University of St. Thomas, who co-authored the study[2]. "Global warming equates to ocean warming. To understand how much the Earth has warmed or how quickly we may warm in the future, we must look to the oceans"[2].</description>

      <title>Chemify says chemistry stuck in 'dark ages,' needs AI</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/chemify-advances-digital-chemp-w6nRbmj3TpOl3R9KUI1VRA</link>
      <description>A Glasgow-based chemistry startup is pioneering a digital revolution in molecular synthesis, arguing that chemistry remains trapped in manual methods while other sciences have embraced automation and artificial intelligence.

In an article published Wednesday, Chemify founder and CEO Lee Cronin declared that "chemistry is stuck in the dark ages" and needs a programmable language to bring it into the digital era[1][2][3]. The University of Glasgow professor argues that while AI can design thousands of hypothetical drug molecules overnight, each still requires human chemists to manually synthesize them—creating a bottleneck that prevents chemistry from matching the speed of computational design[1][2].</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/asian-stocks-mixed-as-investor-_jfzrqWgRKqIkReN1LvpEg</link>
      <description>Asian markets rose on Friday as investors braced for critical US jobs data and a potential Supreme Court decision that could reshape President Donald Trump's tariff policy.

Japan's Nikkei 225 surged 1.61% to close at 51,939.89, powered by a dramatic rally in Fast Retailing, the parent company of Uniqlo, which jumped 10.6% after reporting a 34% surge in quarterly operating profit and raising its annual earnings forecast[1][2]. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 0.3% to 26,231.79, while the Shanghai Composite rose 0.9% to 4,120.43[1]. South Korea's Kospi added 0.8%, though Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 dipped slightly as Rio Tinto shares fell more than 6% following news of preliminary merger talks with Glencore[1].</description>

      <title>Giant virus creates hidden chamber to hijack host cells</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/giant-viruses-create-specializ-5yYc9uZCSzKbWwIcc6fnnA</link>
      <description>Researchers from Kyoto University have discovered that a giant virus infecting amoebas creates a specialized subcellular environment to overcome a fundamental genetic incompatibility with its host, revealing a strategy that may be widespread among viral pathogens[1][2].

The study, published in Nature Microbiology, focused on Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus, which possesses a genome with only 28% GC content while its amoeba host has 58% GC content[1][2]. This mismatch in codon usage should theoretically hinder viral protein production, yet the virus thrives.</description>

      <title>Grok AI limits image editing to paid users after deepfake scandal</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/grok-ai-limits-image-generatio-N5F_4UhyQmqc9kxUrRa93w</link>
      <description>Elon Musk's social media platform X has limited Grok AI's image generation and editing capabilities to paying subscribers, a move that follows widespread criticism over the tool's use in creating sexualized deepfakes of women and children without consent[1][2][3][4]. As of Friday morning, users attempting to edit images through the chatbot receive a message stating that "image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers"[3][4][5].

The restriction comes after governments in the UK, European Union, India, Malaysia, and France launched investigations into X and xAI, the company behind Grok, over concerns that the AI tool enabled the creation of illegal content[6][7][8][9]. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the images as "disgraceful" and "disgusting," telling X to "get a grip" and pledging full government support for regulator Ofcom to take action[10][11][12].</description>

      <title>China to end export tax rebates for solar, batteries</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/china-cuts-and-cancels-export-7jEs4NuMQIuDERpb.YUP5Q</link>
      <description>China announced Thursday it will eliminate export tax rebates for solar products and phase out rebates for batteries, marking an escalation of Beijing's efforts to address overcapacity and ease international trade tensions in its clean energy sector.

The Ministry of Finance said value-added tax export rebates for photovoltaic products will be canceled starting April 1, 2026[1][2][3]. For battery products, the rebate rate will be reduced from 9% to 6% between April 1 and December 31, 2026, then eliminated entirely on January 1, 2027[1][2][3]. The announcement was made public on January 9, 2026, according to The Hindu BusinessLine[1].

The policy shift follows a previous reduction in December 2024, when the rebate rate for solar and battery products dropped from 13% to 9%[4][5]. China's dominant manufacturers—including JinkoSolar, LONGi, Trina Solar, and battery giants CATL and BYD—face increased export costs as the rebates disappear[6][7].</description>

      <title>China rejects Japan appeal to lift export controls</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/china-japan-tensions-rise-over-lKV9dK_TRd2AXHKEVI1kLQ</link>
      <description>Diplomatic and economic frictions between China and Japan intensified Friday as Beijing rejected Tokyo's appeals to lift export restrictions while Japanese officials confirmed widespread delays in agricultural shipments at Chinese customs, capping a week of mounting tensions between Asia's two largest economies.

Chinese Ambassador Wu Jianghao dismissed a Japanese Foreign Ministry petition Thursday to retract newly imposed export controls on dual-use items—products and technologies serving both civilian and military purposes—according to the Chinese embassy in Japan[1][2]. The restrictions, which China's Ministry of Commerce announced January 6 and implemented immediately, prohibit exports to Japan for military use or any purpose that could enhance Japanese military capabilities[3][4][5].

The measures came in direct response to comments by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who suggested in November that Japan could intervene militarily if China used force against self-governed Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory[3][1][6]. Wu called China's actions "entirely legitimate, reasonable and lawful" and vital to national security[1][2].</description>

      <description>Elon Musk's social media platform X limited its Grok AI image generation tool to paying subscribers only on Friday, following mounting international pressure over the chatbot's role in creating thousands of non-consensual sexualized images of women and children[1][2][3].

The restriction came after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer threatened to ban X entirely and called the imagery "disgraceful" and "disgusting"[1][4]. Downing Street condemned the paywall approach as "insulting" to victims, stating it "simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service"[2][5].</description>

      <title>Iran's Khamenei vows no retreat as crackdown kills 42</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/iran-supreme-leader-vows-no-ba-AAj2NnNmSauLbrpZKQS4kA</link>
      <description>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared Friday that the government will not back down against nationwide protests, accusing demonstrators of destroying public property to satisfy U.S. President Donald Trump as the regime tightened its crackdown on dissent[1][2][3][4][5].

"They are ruining their own streets to make the president of another country happy," Khamenei said in a televised address, dismissing Trump as having hands "stained with the blood of Iranians" while supporters chanted "Death to America"[1][2][3][6][5]. His defiant stance came as Iran's judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei separately warned that punishment for protesters "will be decisive, maximum and without any legal leniency"[1][7][5][8].

At least 42 people have been killed and more than 2,270 detained since demonstrations erupted December 28 over Iran's economic crisis, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency[1][9][3][10][5][11]. The death toll includes 29 protesters, eight security personnel, and five minors[11][12]. Rights groups warned the actual numbers could be higher due to a nationwide internet and phone blackout imposed Thursday[9][13][10][6].</description>

      <title>Pakistan nears $1.5B weapons deal with Sudan</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/pakistan-nears-1-5-billion-arm-yXTpA.MLTCCwEQVvyQrMPg</link>
      <description>Pakistan is in the final stages of a $1.5 billion weapons deal with Sudan, sources said Thursday, marking another major defense export for Islamabad as the cash-strapped nation seeks to leverage its growing arms industry. The agreement would supply jets, drones, and advanced air defense systems to Sudan's army as it battles paramilitary forces in a civil war that has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

The deal encompasses 10 Karakoram-8 light attack aircraft, more than 200 drones for reconnaissance and strike missions, and air defense systems, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity[1][2][3][4]. Aamir Masood, a retired Pakistani air marshal who continues to be briefed on air force matters, described the agreement as a "done deal"[1][2][3][4].

The weapons package may also include Super Mushshak training aircraft and possibly JF-17 fighters developed jointly with China, though Masood did not provide figures or a delivery schedule[1][2][4]. Pakistan's military and defense ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment, nor did a spokesman for Sudan's army[1][4].</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump announced Friday that he has canceled a previously expected second wave of military attacks against Venezuela, citing cooperation from the country's interim government including the release of political prisoners[1][2].

In a statement posted on his social media platform, Trump declared that "at least 100 Billion Dollars" would be invested by major oil companies in rebuilding Venezuela's oil and gas infrastructure, adding that he would meet with the executives at the White House later that day[1][2]. Despite the cancellation, Trump emphasized that "all ships will stay in place for safety and security purposes"[1][2].

The announcement came one day after Venezuela began releasing a significant number of political detainees, including prominent opposition figures Enrique Márquez, a former presidential candidate, and Biagio Pilieri, as well as security analyst Rocío San Miguel and five Spanish nationals[3][4][5]. The releases represent the first signs of cooperation since U.S. forces captured President Nicolás Maduro in a special operations raid on January 3[6][7][8].</description>

      <title>Black hole shreds star in brightest explosion ever seen</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/black-hole-shreds-star-in-reco-BQwRTb9uTfCzfR3iVBfy3g</link>
      <description>Astronomers have captured one of the most powerful cosmic explosions ever observed, an event that released energy equivalent to 400 billion suns as a black hole tore apart and devoured a massive star. The discovery, presented this week at the American Astronomical Society conference in Phoenix, provides unprecedented insight into how black holes feed and the extreme physics governing these violent encounters[1][2][3][4].

The event, officially designated AT2024wpp and nicknamed "the Whippet," was first detected on September 25, 2024, by the Zwicky Transient Facility at Palomar Observatory in California[5][6]. Located approximately 1.1 billion light-years from Earth, it represents the brightest example to date of a Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient, a rare class of cosmic explosion that scientists are still working to understand[2][7][5].

"We discovered what we think is a black hole merging with a massive companion star, shredding it into a disk that feeds the black hole," said Daniel Perley, the study's lead author from Liverpool John Moores University, at the conference[1][2][3]. "This was many times more energetic than any similar event and more than any known explosion powered by the collapse of a star."</description>

      <description>Ukraine initiated an urgent United Nations Security Council meeting on Friday following Russia's use of its advanced Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile against the western Lviv region, marking only the second deployment of the hypersonic weapon in combat and escalating tensions as peace negotiations continue.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha declared the strike near the European Union and NATO borders "a grave threat to the security on the European continent and a test for the transatlantic community," calling for decisive international action including meetings of the Ukraine-NATO Council and responses within the EU, Council of Europe, and OSCE[1][2][3].</description>

      <title>Greenland official wants talks with US without Denmark</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/greenland-floats-meeting-trump-j3Nef8qJQfOfXxcUS2IYpQ</link>
      <description>Greenland's foreign minister suggested that the Arctic territory should meet with the United States independently without Denmark present, signaling that American pressure tactics may be driving a wedge between Copenhagen and Nuuk as President Donald Trump continues to pursue his ambitions to acquire the island.

Vivian Motzfeldt told Danish broadcaster DR on Friday that Greenland should "take the lead" in discussions with Washington[1][2]. "When it comes to Greenland, it should be Greenland that takes the lead and speaks with the United States," she said[2]. "What would be wrong with us holding meetings with the United States on our own?"[1][2]

The comments come ahead of a scheduled meeting next week between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and officials from both Denmark and Greenland, marking the first significant three-way dialogue since Trump intensified his push to gain control of the territory[1][3][4]. While Motzfeldt acknowledged that the upcoming meeting would include Denmark and that Greenland still lacks authority over its own foreign policy, her remarks underscore growing tensions over how the semi-autonomous territory should navigate US pressure[1][2].</description>

      <title>Malaysia says Grok ban won't lift until X proves misuse 'will no longer occur'</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/malaysia-and-indonesia-block-g-52YkM94VTFeQ2idrFnsBHA</link>
      <description>Malaysia and Indonesia have become the first countries in the world to block access to Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok after regulators determined the tool was being used to generate sexually explicit and nonconsensual deepfake images, including content depicting women and minors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indonesia's Ministry of Communication and Digital Affairs ordered restrictions on January 10, with Malaysia's Communications and Multimedia Commission following on January 11. The bans came after officials in both countries concluded that safeguards implemented by xAI, the company behind Grok, had failed to stop the spread of obscene content on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.</description>

      <description>The United States has intensified its condemnation of South Africa following the "Will for Peace 2026" naval exercises that concluded on Friday off Cape Town's coast, with the House Committee on Foreign Affairs accusing Pretoria of undermining American national security. The criticism comes one day after the US Embassy in South Africa publicly lambasted the country for allowing Iran to participate in the drills alongside Chinese and Russian vessels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The week-long exercises, which ran from January 9 to 16, brought together naval forces from Iran, China, Russia, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates, along with observers from Brazil, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Egypt. The drills are described by South African officials as part of the BRICS Plus framework aimed at enhancing maritime security.</description>

      <description>Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen stood at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday morning, watching as the rocket that will carry him around the moon began its slow journey to the launch pad. Hansen, a 49-year-old from London, Ontario, is set to become the first non-American to travel beyond low Earth orbit when Artemis II lifts off as early as next month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The four-mile rollout of NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft began at 7:04 a.m. EST on January 17, with the 11-million-pound stack creeping toward Launch Complex 39B at about one mile per hour. The journey to the launch pad is expected to take up to 12 hours.</description>

      <description>The Trump administration held months of quiet discussions with Venezuela's interior minister Diosdado Cabello before the January 3 military operation that captured President Nicolás Maduro, and communications have continued since, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter in an exclusive Reuters report published Friday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;U.S. officials warned Cabello, 62, against deploying security services or militant ruling-party supporters to target Venezuela's opposition, four sources told Reuters. The talks also addressed U.S. sanctions imposed on him and his federal drug-trafficking indictment. Despite being named in the same indictment that justified Maduro's arrest—with a $25 million bounty on his head—Cabello was not apprehended during the operation.</description>

      <description>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of being a "criminal" responsible for casualties, destruction, and spreading falsehoods against the Iranian people, as the country emerges from its deadliest unrest in decades with thousands reported killed in a brutal crackdown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We consider the U.S. president a criminal for the casualties, damages, and the slander he inflicted on the Iranian nation," Khamenei said during a speech marking Eid al-Mab'ath, the anniversary of the Prophet Muhammad's mission, according to Iranian media. He described the protests as an "American sedition" designed to "devour Iran."</description>

      <description>French President Emmanuel Macron responded forcefully on Saturday to U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on eight European countries, declaring that "no intimidation or threat will influence us" and promising a united European response to what he called an unacceptable escalation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sharp rebuke came hours after Trump announced on Truth Social that Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland would face a 10 percent tariff on all goods exported to the United States starting February 1, rising to 25 percent on June 1. The levies would remain in place "until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland," Trump said.</description>

      <description>The Trump administration is asking countries that want a permanent spot on President Donald Trump's new Board of Peace to contribute at least $1 billion, according to a draft charter of the body sent to world leaders this weekend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The provision, outlined in the charter distributed alongside invitation letters on Friday, effectively creates a two-tier membership structure. Countries that contribute $1 billion or more in cash funds to the Board of Peace would be exempt from the standard three-year membership term, securing them a permanent seat on the panel.</description>

      <description>European Union lawmakers are poised to freeze approval of the EU-US trade deal after President Donald Trump announced tariffs on eight NATO allies Saturday in his latest bid to acquire Greenland. The move marks a dramatic escalation in transatlantic tensions, jeopardizing the landmark agreement struck just six months ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Manfred Weber, president of the European People's Party—the largest political faction in the European Parliament—declared that proceeding with the trade deal is no longer feasible. "The EPP is in favor of the EU-US trade deal, but given Donald Trump's threats regarding Greenland, approval is not possible at this stage," Weber posted on social media Saturday, adding that "zero tariffs on US products must now be put on hold."</description>

      <description>Ambassadors from the European Union's 27 member states will convene for an emergency meeting on Sunday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a wave of escalating tariffs on European allies over their opposition to the American acquisition of Greenland, an unprecedented move that threatens to fracture the transatlantic alliance and ignite a new trade war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cyprus, which holds the EU's six-month rotating presidency, called the urgent session late Saturday, with diplomats indicating it is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. GMT. European Council President António Costa confirmed he is coordinating a collective response from member states, stating, "The EU will maintain its stance on upholding international law, wherever it is applicable".</description>

      <description>The artificial intelligence revolution is reshaping the global energy landscape, with tech giants racing to secure nuclear power contracts as data center electricity consumption threatens to strain power grids worldwide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Global electricity demand is expected to increase by more than 10,000 terawatt-hours by 2035, a figure equivalent to the total consumption of all advanced economies today, according to a UN report released this week. The International Energy Agency estimates that data center electricity demand grew by more than 75 percent between 2023 and 2024, and the sector is expected to account for over 20 percent of electricity-demand growth in advanced economies by 2030.</description>

      <description>An Iranian official acknowledged on Sunday that authorities have verified at least 5,000 deaths during three weeks of nationwide protests, the first such confirmation from within the government as the Islamic Republic's deadliest crackdown in decades appears to have temporarily suppressed street demonstrations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The figure, which includes approximately 500 security personnel, was disclosed by a regional official speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity. The official blamed "terrorists and armed rioters" for the casualties, while attributing support for protesters to "Israel and armed groups abroad." The acknowledgment follows Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's admission on Saturday that "several thousand" had died during the unrest.</description>

      <description>Chinese customs authorities have blocked shipments of NVIDIA Corporation's H200 artificial intelligence processors, prompting suppliers of specialized components to halt production amid what industry analysts describe as a sudden and unexpected reversal in trade relations between the world's two largest economies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The move, first reported by the Financial Times on January 16, came after customs officials in Shenzhen summoned logistics companies on January 7 and instructed them not to accept customs clearance applications for H200 chips. Early shipments of H200s were already arriving in Hong Kong when the blockade took effect, catching Nvidia off guard, according to sources familiar with the matter.</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/iran-president-warns-strikes-o-_Yk45mnwSxCHdtrv9fmNgg</link>
      <description>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian declared Sunday that any attack on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would be "tantamount to all-out war against the Iranian nation," escalating a war of words with Washington after President Donald Trump called for "new leadership" in Tehran.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Any aggression against the supreme leader of our country is tantamount to all-out war against the Iranian nation," Pezeshkian wrote on the social media platform X. The Iranian president also blamed Washington for his country's economic struggles, citing "longstanding enmity and inhumane sanctions" imposed by the United States and its allies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pezeshkian's warning followed a sharp exchange between Trump and Khamenei on Saturday. In an interview with Politico, Trump said "it's time to look for new leadership in Iran," calling the 86-year-old supreme leader "a sick man who should run his country properly and stop killing people". Trump added that Iran under Khamenei's rule was "the worst place to live anywhere in the world because of poor leadership".</description>

      <description>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer directly challenged President Donald Trump on Sunday, telling him in a phone call that imposing tariffs on NATO allies over Greenland is "wrong." The conversation came one day after Trump announced sweeping tariffs against eight European nations in his latest effort to pressure Denmark into selling the Arctic territory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to an official Downing Street statement, Starmer spoke with Trump after first coordinating with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. "He said that security in the High North is a priority for all NATO allies in order to protect Euro-Atlantic interests," Downing Street said.

      <description>The Syrian government and the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces reached a ceasefire agreement on Sunday following days of intense combat that saw government troops rapidly advance through Kurdish-held territories in the country's north and east, seizing strategic oil fields and key cities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa and SDF commander Mazloum Abdi signed the 14-point accord, which state media described as an "immediate and comprehensive" halt to hostilities across all fronts. The agreement marks a watershed moment in Damascus's efforts to reassert control over nearly all of Syria following the toppling of Bashar Assad in December 2024.</description>

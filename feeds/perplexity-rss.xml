      <title>Denmark deploys combat troops to Greenland amid Trump threats</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/denmark-deploys-substantial-tr-ZO5hBrBhRSa5ec9F.ongLg</link>
      <description>Denmark is deploying a substantial contingent of combat soldiers to Greenland on Monday evening, with Army Chief Major General Peter Boysen accompanying the forces as Copenhagen reinforces its Arctic presence in the face of escalating pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to acquire the self-governing territory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Danish Armed Forces confirmed to broadcaster TV 2 that the additional troops are scheduled to arrive in Kangerlussuaq, describing the deployment as "a substantial contribution." Around 100 Danish soldiers had already arrived in Nuuk, Greenland's capital, with a similar number stationed in Kangerlussuaq before the latest reinforcement.</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/denmark-and-greenland-propose-4hC1fdczRViHoVye5aIMJA</link>
      <description>Denmark and Greenland have formally proposed establishing a NATO surveillance mission in the Arctic, Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen announced Monday after meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in Brussels. The proposal marks an attempt to address escalating transatlantic tensions sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's push to acquire the strategically located island.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We have proposed it, the secretary general has taken note of that, and I think we can now—we hope—define a framework on how that can be concretised," Poulsen told Danish television following the meeting, which also included Greenlandic Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt.</description>

      <title>Greenland dispute could suck oxygen from Davos talks, Stubb says</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/greenland-dispute-could-suck-o-00XWuVBRQuqYCPauvdIhFQ</link>
      <description>Finnish President Alexander Stubb voiced concerns on Monday that escalating tensions over Greenland will "suck out all the oxygen" at this week's World Economic Forum in Davos, potentially sidelining critical discussions about ending Russia's war in Ukraine and securing the country's reconstruction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We are doing everything we can to avoid that," Stubb told reporters in Davos on Monday, adding that "for Ukraine, the best that can come out of Davos is some kind of an agreement on an economic plan or reconstruction".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The warning comes as the 56th World Economic Forum opened January 19 under the theme "A Spirit of Dialogue," with nearly 3,000 participants from more than 130 countries, including approximately 65 heads of state and six G7 leaders. Yet the gathering has been upended by President Donald Trump's threat to impose escalating tariffs on European allies unless they acquiesce to American acquisition of Greenland.</description>

      <description>As more than 850 chief executives gather in the Swiss Alps for the World Economic Forum, both the United States and China are competing for their attention, with President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng scheduling separate meetings with global business leaders amid renewed trade talks and escalating geopolitical tensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump plans to convene a group of corporate executives Wednesday evening following his anticipated speech at the forum, according to Semafor and Reuters. The invitations, sent from the White House, caught some executives off guard Monday, forcing corporate staffers to scramble to rework schedules that had been months in the making.</description>

      <title>1,500 ISIS prisoners escape Syrian facility as ceasefire collapses</title>

      <description>Approximately 1,500 Islamic State members escaped from Shaddadi prison in northeastern Syria on Monday, according to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, as a ceasefire deal between Kurdish fighters and the Damascus government appeared to collapse just one day after it was announced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SDF spokesperson Farhad Shami told the Kurdish website Rudaw that the mass prison break occurred after "Damascus factions" launched repeated attacks on the facility, which held thousands of ISIS detainees. The Syrian army denied attacking the prison and instead accused the SDF of deliberately releasing the militants. By Monday evening, Syrian officials said they had regained control of both the city and the prison, and imposed a curfew while troops searched for escapees.</description>

      <description>As the United States and Iran trade escalating threats amid Tehran's bloody crackdown on protesters, nuclear experts are sounding alarms about the potential for Iran's nuclear materials to fall into the wrong hands during a period of internal chaos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The warning, detailed in a report by the Associated Press, comes as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has acknowledged losing visibility over Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium following U.S. and Israeli airstrikes on nuclear facilities last June.</description>

      <description>Antarctic penguins are advancing their breeding seasons at record rates as their habitats warm up to four times faster than the continental average, according to research released on World Penguin Awareness Day that identifies the fastest such shift ever recorded in any bird — and possibly any vertebrate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The decade-long study, published Tuesday in the Journal of Animal Ecology, found that three penguin species on the Antarctic Peninsula are now beginning their reproductive cycles approximately two weeks earlier than they did a decade ago, with some colonies shifting by nearly a month.</description>

      <title>World Economic Forum opens without founder Schwab for first time</title>

      <description>The 56th World Economic Forum Annual Meeting commenced in Davos on Monday evening, marking the first time in the event's history that founder Klaus Schwab was not at the helm. Interim co-chairs Larry Fink and André Hoffmann opened proceedings with welcoming remarks at an opening concert, signaling a new chapter for the influential gathering of global elites.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Schwab, 87, stepped down as chairman in April 2025, effective immediately, after the WEF board moved to investigate whistleblower allegations of financial and ethical misconduct involving him and his wife, Hilde. The Wall Street Journal first reported that an anonymous letter to the board accused the Schwabs of improperly intermingling personal finances with forum resources, including allegations that Schwab directed subordinates to withdraw thousands of dollars from ATMs on his behalf and used WEF funds for private hotel massages.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump is set to take center stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, where trade tensions with European allies over his renewed push to acquire Greenland threaten to dominate proceedings at the elite annual gathering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 56th World Economic Forum, running January 19-23, has been overshadowed by Trump's weekend announcement of new tariffs targeting eight European nations — Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark — unless a deal is reached allowing the United States to purchase Greenland, the mineral-rich Danish territory in the Arctic.</description>

      <description>Stock markets across Asia and Europe tumbled Tuesday as investors grappled with escalating trade tensions after President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on eight European nations in his bid to acquire Greenland, while Japan's snap election announcement failed to lift regional sentiment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.8% on Tuesday, extending its worst session in over two months, while the STOXX 50 declined 0.4%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped approximately 0.8%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng and China's Shanghai Composite shed 0.1% to 0.5%.</description>

      <description>Scientists in China and Hong Kong have announced separate advances in perovskite solar cell technology this month, addressing long-standing challenges with both efficiency and stability that have hindered the material's commercial adoption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A research team from Northwestern Polytechnical University, in collaboration with Xi'an Shiyou University and Xidian University, developed a novel crystallization strategy using a two-dimensional seeding agent to achieve 31.13% efficiency in a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell. Separately, engineers at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology created a "Molecular Velcro" coating that enables cells to retain over 95% of their initial efficiency after more than 1,100 hours of continuous operation under intense heat.</description>

      <title>Hubble images show interstellar object's jets in rare symmetry</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/harvard-astrophysicist-finds-u-G4JmLTFmQYSyzXGwgBWNbg</link>
      <description>New images of the interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS from the Hubble Space Telescope have revealed an unusual configuration of jets emanating from its nucleus, with three distinct plumes arranged in near-perfect 120-degree symmetry. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who has been analyzing the data, says the geometric precision of the formation is difficult to reconcile with standard cometary outgassing and raises questions about the object's origins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Images captured by Hubble on January 7 and January 14, 2026, and processed by researcher Toni Scarmato using the Larson-Sekanina Rotational Gradient filter, show three collimated mini-jets extending tens of thousands of kilometers into space, each separated by exactly 120 degrees in projection. A fourth "anti-tail" jet points directly toward the sun, stretching up to 400,000 kilometers — a length that Loeb argues has never been reported before for solar system comets.</description>

      <description>Japanese government bonds experienced a historic meltdown on Tuesday as fiscal concerns over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's unfunded tax cut promises sent long-dated yields surging to levels not seen in decades, triggering a selloff that spread across global financial markets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The yield on Japan's 40-year government bond rocketed past 4%, the highest since this maturity was introduced in 2007 and a first for any sovereign debt instrument in the country in more than three decades. The 30-year yield climbed to a record 3.875%, while the benchmark 10-year yield rose above 2.3%, its highest level since 1999.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump intensified his campaign to acquire Greenland on Tuesday, posting AI-generated images of himself planting an American flag on the Arctic territory while threatening European allies with tariffs unless they relent on what he called an "imperative" matter of national security. The escalating pressure comes as European leaders prepare for tense meetings at the World Economic Forum in Davos, with EU officials vowing an "unflinching" response to what they describe as coercion against a longtime ally.</description>

      <description>Ukraine's Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant has been reconnected to the country's power grid following a massive overnight Russian drone and missile assault that temporarily knocked out all external power to the facility, with officials confirming radiation levels remain normal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed early Tuesday that the plant, site of the world's worst civil nuclear disaster, had lost all off-site power after Russian forces targeted energy infrastructure across Ukraine. "Several Ukrainian electrical substations vital for nuclear safety were affected by widespread military activity this morning," IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said on X.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ukraine's energy ministry announced later Tuesday that power had been restored and radiation levels posed no threat.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump's newly established Board of Peace is encountering resistance from key allies as world leaders grapple with a controversial charter requiring $1 billion for permanent membership and granting Trump near-total control over the international body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The initiative, originally conceived to oversee Gaza's reconstruction following the October 2025 ceasefire, has evolved into a far more ambitious enterprise. According to the charter, which has been reviewed by multiple news outlets, the board aims to "promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict"—language that makes no mention of Gaza.</description>

      <description>Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen on Tuesday told residents to prepare for a possible military invasion, delivering a stark warning as tensions between the United States and European allies over the Arctic territory escalate to unprecedented levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It's not likely there will be a military conflict, but it can't be ruled out," Nielsen said at a press conference in the capital Nuuk. "The leader on the other side, US President Donald Trump, has said very clearly that it is not out of the question, and we should of course be prepared for all possible scenarios."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The warning comes as Greenlanders grapple with the reality of life at the center of an international crisis, with residents stockpiling supplies and planning escape routes while refusing to bow to American pressure.</description>

      <description>Israeli bulldozers tore down buildings at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) headquarters in occupied East Jerusalem on Tuesday morning, in what the UN agency condemned as an "unprecedented attack" and a serious violation of international law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shortly after 7 a.m. local time, Israeli forces entered the compound in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, expelled security personnel, confiscated staff equipment, and began demolishing structures with heavy machinery, according to UNRWA spokesperson Jonathan Fowler. An Israeli flag was raised over the premises, replacing the UN flag.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir arrived at the scene to observe the demolition. "This is a historic day, a day of celebration, and a very important day for governance in Jerusalem," Ben-Gvir said in a statement. "For years, these supporters of terrorism were here, and today they are being removed from here along with everything they built."</description>

      <title>Canada has 'no intention' of China free trade deal, Carney says</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/carney-rejects-china-trade-dea-S7Pjtfz0RVS9kcl97lQMRg</link>
      <description>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney declared Sunday that Canada has "no intention" of pursuing a free trade agreement with China, pushing back against President Donald Trump's threat to impose 100 percent tariffs on all Canadian goods if Ottawa strikes a broader trade pact with Beijing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We have no intention of doing that with China or any other nonmarket economy," Carney told reporters in Ottawa, emphasizing that the recent agreement with Beijing merely addressed specific tariff disputes that emerged over the past two years.</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/platinum-silver-and-palladium-HH4TDUvYSHSYZ165HPNBXQ</link>
      <description>Platinum, silver, and palladium surged to fresh all-time highs on Sunday as a historic rally in precious metals continued unabated, driven by safe-haven demand amid geopolitical turmoil and expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Reuters via MarketScreener, spot platinum climbed more than 3% to reach $2,859.25 per ounce, while spot silver extended its gains to rise nearly 5% to $107.99 per ounce—its highest level ever. Palladium also rallied, rising 3% to $2,076.93 per ounce.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The moves come as gold breached the $5,000 per ounce mark for the first time on Saturday, according to the BBC, capping a week in which precious metals posted extraordinary gains. Silver has now gained more than 40% since the start of 2026 after rallying 147% in 2025, Reuters reported.</description>

      <description>Chinese marine scientists have identified approximately 1,730 distinct viruses lurking in the oxygen-depleted depths of the world's deepest known underwater blue hole, revealing a hidden ecosystem teeming with microbial life forms largely unknown to science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The discovery, conducted by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, centers on the Yongle Blue Hole, colloquially known as the "Dragon Hole," a massive marine sinkhole in the South China Sea that plunges nearly 1,000 feet into the ocean floor. The findings, detailed in research published in the journal Environmental Microbiome, indicate that approximately 77 percent of the viruses detected had never been recorded before and could not be matched to existing databases.</description>

      <description>European Union countries on Monday gave final approval to a law banning Russian gas imports by late 2027, marking a decisive step in the bloc's effort to end its energy dependence on Moscow nearly four years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under the approved legislation, the EU will halt Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports by the end of 2026 and pipeline gas by September 30, 2027. The deadline may extend to November 1, 2027, if a member state struggles to fill its gas storage with non-Russian supplies ahead of winter.</description>

      <description>Gold smashed through the $5,000 barrier for the first time on Monday, climbing to a record above $5,100 as investors piled into safe-haven assets amid a weaker dollar and mounting speculation that the United States and Japan may jointly intervene to prop up the yen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spot gold touched an all-time high of $5,110.50 per ounce, extending a historic rally that has seen the precious metal gain more than 17% in the first weeks of 2026, following a 64% surge last year — its biggest annual gain since 1979. Silver continued its parallel ascent, scaling new peaks above $109 an ounce after breaking $100 for the first time on Friday.</description>

      <description>Venezuela's interim leader Delcy Rodríguez delivered a pointed rebuke to Washington on Sunday, declaring that she has had "enough" of orders from the United States as her government navigates the precarious aftermath of former President Nicolás Maduro's capture by American forces earlier this month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Enough orders from Washington on politicians in Venezuela. Let Venezuelan politics resolve our differences and internal conflicts. Enough of foreign powers," Rodríguez said in an address to oil workers at the Puerto La Cruz refinery in the eastern state of Anzoátegui, according to Xinhua and CNN. The speech, broadcast on state-run television, marked a notable shift in tone from the acting president who initially received backing from the Trump administration.</description>

      <description>The Israeli Defense Forces announced Monday that the body of Master Sgt. Ran Gvili, the last remaining Israeli hostage from the October 7, 2023 attacks, has been found and identified in a Gaza cemetery, bringing a 28-month ordeal to a close and clearing the path for a contentious reopening of the Rafah border crossing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The recovery marks the end of a chapter that began when 251 people were taken captive during Hamas's attack on southern Israel. With Gvili's return, no Israeli hostages remain in the Gaza Strip for the first time in over two years.</description>

      <description>Astronomers have produced the highest-resolution map of dark matter ever created, using data from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. The new map, published January 26 in Nature Astronomy, confirms with unprecedented clarity how dark matter's gravity shaped the structure of the cosmos by drawing normal matter toward it throughout billions of years of cosmic history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research, led by scientists from Durham University in the United Kingdom and Northeastern University in the United States as part of the COSMOS-Web collaboration, analyzed Webb observations of a section of sky about 2.5 times larger than the full moon in the constellation Sextans.</description>

      <description>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa stood alongside Indian leaders on Monday as chief guests at India's 77th Republic Day parade in New Delhi, marking the first time both EU heads have jointly attended the celebration. The visit comes as both sides prepare to formally announce the conclusion of negotiations on a free trade agreement at the 16th India-EU Summit on Tuesday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;India's Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agrawal confirmed Monday that the two sides have successfully wrapped up talks on the FTA, ending 18 years of negotiations that began in 2007, were suspended in 2013, and revived in 2022. "Negotiations have been successfully concluded. The deal has been finalised," Agrawal said, adding that legal review of the text is underway and both sides aim to sign the pact this year, with implementation expected early next year.</description>

      <description>The United States has escalated its pressure campaign on Iran, imposing fresh sanctions on nine vessels and their management firms while positioning the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier within striking distance of the Islamic Republic as tensions between Washington and Tehran reach their highest point in years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The aircraft carrier arrived in the Middle East on Sunday evening near Iran, according to Israel's Channel 13. The arrival of the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, accompanied by guided-missile destroyers and missile defense systems being deployed to the region, represents what President Donald Trump has called a U.S. "armada" approaching Iran.</description>

The upcoming talks will build on initial meetings held January 23-24 in the United Arab Emirates capital, marking the first trilateral format in months to include political and military representatives from all three countries.</description>

      <description>Yemen's Houthi rebels and Iraq's Kataib Hezbollah have issued coordinated threats of military action in support of Iran as the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group enters Middle Eastern waters, raising fears that a potential U.S.-Iran confrontation could ignite a broader regional conflict.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The threats from Iran's proxy forces mark a departure from June 2025, when members of the so-called "axis of resistance" notably refrained from coming to Tehran's defense during a 12-day war with Israel that also saw U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.</description>

You can't," Rutte told the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs and Committee on Security and Defence in Brussels. "We need each other."</description>

      <description>Two wooden artifacts found at an ancient lake shore in Greece have been confirmed as the oldest handheld wooden tools ever discovered, dating back 430,000 years and revealing that early human ancestors were crafting wooden implements long before the emergence of Homo sapiens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The discovery, published January 26 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, includes a digging stick and a smaller tool of unknown purpose. Both objects show clear evidence of intentional shaping by human hands.</description>

      <title>Trump warns Iran over protester deaths as internet blackout spreads</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-warns-iran-of-severe-con-Trv4bXE3S4qNA7aXNXZ.Uw</link>
      <description>US President Donald Trump issued stark warnings to Iran on Thursday that Washington would respond with force if authorities continue killing peaceful protesters, as the Islamic Republic plunged into a nationwide internet blackout amid the largest demonstrations in more than three years.

Speaking with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on January 8, Trump declared that Iranian authorities would "have to pay hell" if they persist in lethal violence against demonstrators[1][2][3]. "I have let them know that if they start killing people, which they tend to do during their riots—they have lots of riots—if they do it, we are going to hit them very hard," Trump stated[2]. The warning came as human rights groups reported at least 39 to 45 protesters have been killed since demonstrations erupted in late December, including eight minors[4][5][6][7].

The protests, which began December 28 at Tehran's Grand Bazaar over economic grievances, have spread to all 31 provinces[4][8]. Violence intensified on Thursday evening after exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi called for coordinated demonstrations at 8 p.m. local time[9][5]. Witnesses reported crowds chanting "Death to the dictator" and "Pahlavi will return" across Tehran and other major cities[9][5].</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/kim-jong-un-pledges-permanent-wuJxyv_qTgeEmg9b6caraw</link>
      <description>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has promised Russian President Vladimir Putin unconditional and permanent support for all his policies, according to a letter reported by state media KCNA on Friday[1][2][3][4][5].

"I will unconditionally respect and unconditionally support all your policies and decisions and I have a willingness to be always with you for the sake of you and your Russia," Kim wrote to Putin[1][2][5]. "This choice will be constant and permanent."

The letter, which KCNA said was a response to an earlier message from Putin, marks the latest expression of deepening ties between the two nations as North Korea provides critical military support to Russia's war in Ukraine[1][2][3][5].</description>

      <title>Cambodia pushes back on Thai claims over border scam centers</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/cambodia-and-thailand-agree-to-8MjrV9KDQqCyQKw5AdnI7A</link>
      <description>Cambodia's Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol said on Wednesday his country wants to "lower the temperature" with Thailand and pushed back against Bangkok's claims that recent border clashes were focused on combating scam centers, as both nations work to maintain a fragile 11-day-old ceasefire[1].

The comments come after Thailand and Cambodia signed a renewed ceasefire agreement on December 27, ending three weeks of fighting that killed at least 101 people and displaced more than half a million on both sides of the border[2][3]. Thailand released 18 Cambodian soldiers on December 31 who had been held as prisoners of war for 155 days, a move described by Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as "a gesture of goodwill and trust-building"[2].</description>

      <title>Russian missiles kill one, wound 24 in Zelenskyy's hometown</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/russian-missile-strikes-on-kry-xGeB2vTmScq2761GYBWj9A</link>
      <description>Two Russian Iskander ballistic missiles struck residential apartment buildings in Kryvyi Rih on Thursday evening, killing at least one person and wounding 24 others, including six children, in President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's hometown. The attack came as Russia continued its systematic targeting of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, leaving hundreds of thousands without power, water, and heating amid freezing temperatures[1][2][3][4].

The missiles hit the city around 5 p.m. local time, damaging approximately 15 apartment buildings and nearby vehicles[5][6][7]. Among the casualties was a 77-year-old woman who died in the strike, while the wounded included children aged 7 and 16[8][9]. One man who lost a leg in the explosion remained in critical condition and underwent surgery[5][8].</description>

      <title>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS puzzles scientists with three symmetrical jets</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/interstellar-comet-3iatlas-dis-4Et_MP8GQD2DJHV0Qe0oRA</link>
      <description>As the rare interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS speeds through our solar system on its way toward Jupiter, astronomers have detected an unusual feature that has moved the scientific conversation from curiosity to genuine puzzle: the ancient comet is producing three perfectly symmetrical jets of material, separated by a strikingly consistent 120 degrees.

The phenomenon, confirmed through observations by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii between late November and late December 2025, defies standard models of how comets behave[1][2]. While most comets vent gas and dust in irregular, flickering plumes as they are heated by the sun, 3I/ATLAS has maintained this geometric precision for weeks, with each jet displaying comparable brightness and curvature[1][3].</description>

      <title>Ancient humans may have met at Indonesian cave 40,000 years ago</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/sulawesi-cave-dig-reveals-anci-qTUPoZqXRr.pHu4ubLJ8zg</link>
      <description>A deep excavation in Indonesia has uncovered evidence that modern humans and an extinct hominin species may have overlapped at the same cave site more than 40,000 years ago, according to research published Wednesday by an international archaeological team led by Griffith University.

The findings from Leang Bulu Bettue, a limestone cave in southern Sulawesi, reveal a dramatic shift in the archaeological record around 40,000 years ago that researchers believe marks the arrival of Homo sapiens and the possible replacement of archaic hominins who had occupied the island for over a million years[1][2][3][4].

"The depth and continuity of the cultural sequence at Leang Bulu Bettue now positions this cave as a flagship site for investigating whether these two human lineages overlapped in time," said Basran Burhan, a Griffith PhD candidate who led the study published in PLOS ONE[2][4].</description>

      <title>Oceans set heat record in 2025 for ninth straight year</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/oceans-absorbed-record-heat-in-47VXWjTkTQaAGSz8NhyJ6A</link>
      <description>Earth's oceans absorbed a record-breaking amount of heat in 2025, marking the ninth consecutive year of unprecedented warming and intensifying concerns about extreme weather, rising seas, and collapsing marine ecosystems, according to research published Friday by an international team of scientists.

The upper 2,000 meters of the world's oceans absorbed 23 zettajoules more energy than in 2024—an amount equivalent to roughly 37 years of global energy consumption—according to the study in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences[1][2][3][4][5]. The research involved more than 50 scientists from 31 institutions across three continents[3][4].

"Every year, we are witnessing an increase in global temperatures—setting new records has become a recurring theme," said Prof. John Abraham from the University of St. Thomas, who co-authored the study[2]. "Global warming equates to ocean warming. To understand how much the Earth has warmed or how quickly we may warm in the future, we must look to the oceans"[2].</description>

      <title>Chemify says chemistry stuck in 'dark ages,' needs AI</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/chemify-advances-digital-chemp-w6nRbmj3TpOl3R9KUI1VRA</link>
      <description>A Glasgow-based chemistry startup is pioneering a digital revolution in molecular synthesis, arguing that chemistry remains trapped in manual methods while other sciences have embraced automation and artificial intelligence.

In an article published Wednesday, Chemify founder and CEO Lee Cronin declared that "chemistry is stuck in the dark ages" and needs a programmable language to bring it into the digital era[1][2][3]. The University of Glasgow professor argues that while AI can design thousands of hypothetical drug molecules overnight, each still requires human chemists to manually synthesize them—creating a bottleneck that prevents chemistry from matching the speed of computational design[1][2].</description>

      <description>Asian markets rose on Friday as investors braced for critical US jobs data and a potential Supreme Court decision that could reshape President Donald Trump's tariff policy.

Japan's Nikkei 225 surged 1.61% to close at 51,939.89, powered by a dramatic rally in Fast Retailing, the parent company of Uniqlo, which jumped 10.6% after reporting a 34% surge in quarterly operating profit and raising its annual earnings forecast[1][2]. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 0.3% to 26,231.79, while the Shanghai Composite rose 0.9% to 4,120.43[1]. South Korea's Kospi added 0.8%, though Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 dipped slightly as Rio Tinto shares fell more than 6% following news of preliminary merger talks with Glencore[1].</description>

      <description>Researchers from Kyoto University have discovered that a giant virus infecting amoebas creates a specialized subcellular environment to overcome a fundamental genetic incompatibility with its host, revealing a strategy that may be widespread among viral pathogens[1][2].

The study, published in Nature Microbiology, focused on Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus, which possesses a genome with only 28% GC content while its amoeba host has 58% GC content[1][2]. This mismatch in codon usage should theoretically hinder viral protein production, yet the virus thrives.</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/grok-ai-limits-image-generatio-N5F_4UhyQmqc9kxUrRa93w</link>
      <description>Elon Musk's social media platform X has limited Grok AI's image generation and editing capabilities to paying subscribers, a move that follows widespread criticism over the tool's use in creating sexualized deepfakes of women and children without consent[1][2][3][4]. As of Friday morning, users attempting to edit images through the chatbot receive a message stating that "image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers"[3][4][5].

The restriction comes after governments in the UK, European Union, India, Malaysia, and France launched investigations into X and xAI, the company behind Grok, over concerns that the AI tool enabled the creation of illegal content[6][7][8][9]. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the images as "disgraceful" and "disgusting," telling X to "get a grip" and pledging full government support for regulator Ofcom to take action[10][11][12].</description>

      <title>China to end export tax rebates for solar, batteries</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/china-cuts-and-cancels-export-7jEs4NuMQIuDERpb.YUP5Q</link>
      <description>China announced Thursday it will eliminate export tax rebates for solar products and phase out rebates for batteries, marking an escalation of Beijing's efforts to address overcapacity and ease international trade tensions in its clean energy sector.

The Ministry of Finance said value-added tax export rebates for photovoltaic products will be canceled starting April 1, 2026[1][2][3]. For battery products, the rebate rate will be reduced from 9% to 6% between April 1 and December 31, 2026, then eliminated entirely on January 1, 2027[1][2][3]. The announcement was made public on January 9, 2026, according to The Hindu BusinessLine[1].

The policy shift follows a previous reduction in December 2024, when the rebate rate for solar and battery products dropped from 13% to 9%[4][5]. China's dominant manufacturers—including JinkoSolar, LONGi, Trina Solar, and battery giants CATL and BYD—face increased export costs as the rebates disappear[6][7].</description>

      <description>Diplomatic and economic frictions between China and Japan intensified Friday as Beijing rejected Tokyo's appeals to lift export restrictions while Japanese officials confirmed widespread delays in agricultural shipments at Chinese customs, capping a week of mounting tensions between Asia's two largest economies.

Chinese Ambassador Wu Jianghao dismissed a Japanese Foreign Ministry petition Thursday to retract newly imposed export controls on dual-use items—products and technologies serving both civilian and military purposes—according to the Chinese embassy in Japan[1][2]. The restrictions, which China's Ministry of Commerce announced January 6 and implemented immediately, prohibit exports to Japan for military use or any purpose that could enhance Japanese military capabilities[3][4][5].

The measures came in direct response to comments by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who suggested in November that Japan could intervene militarily if China used force against self-governed Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory[3][1][6]. Wu called China's actions "entirely legitimate, reasonable and lawful" and vital to national security[1][2].</description>

      <description>Elon Musk's social media platform X limited its Grok AI image generation tool to paying subscribers only on Friday, following mounting international pressure over the chatbot's role in creating thousands of non-consensual sexualized images of women and children[1][2][3].

The restriction came after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer threatened to ban X entirely and called the imagery "disgraceful" and "disgusting"[1][4]. Downing Street condemned the paywall approach as "insulting" to victims, stating it "simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service"[2][5].</description>

      <title>Iran's Khamenei vows no retreat as crackdown kills 42</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/iran-supreme-leader-vows-no-ba-AAj2NnNmSauLbrpZKQS4kA</link>
      <description>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared Friday that the government will not back down against nationwide protests, accusing demonstrators of destroying public property to satisfy U.S. President Donald Trump as the regime tightened its crackdown on dissent[1][2][3][4][5].

"They are ruining their own streets to make the president of another country happy," Khamenei said in a televised address, dismissing Trump as having hands "stained with the blood of Iranians" while supporters chanted "Death to America"[1][2][3][6][5]. His defiant stance came as Iran's judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei separately warned that punishment for protesters "will be decisive, maximum and without any legal leniency"[1][7][5][8].

At least 42 people have been killed and more than 2,270 detained since demonstrations erupted December 28 over Iran's economic crisis, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency[1][9][3][10][5][11]. The death toll includes 29 protesters, eight security personnel, and five minors[11][12]. Rights groups warned the actual numbers could be higher due to a nationwide internet and phone blackout imposed Thursday[9][13][10][6].</description>

      <title>Pakistan nears $1.5B weapons deal with Sudan</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/pakistan-nears-1-5-billion-arm-yXTpA.MLTCCwEQVvyQrMPg</link>
      <description>Pakistan is in the final stages of a $1.5 billion weapons deal with Sudan, sources said Thursday, marking another major defense export for Islamabad as the cash-strapped nation seeks to leverage its growing arms industry. The agreement would supply jets, drones, and advanced air defense systems to Sudan's army as it battles paramilitary forces in a civil war that has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

The deal encompasses 10 Karakoram-8 light attack aircraft, more than 200 drones for reconnaissance and strike missions, and air defense systems, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity[1][2][3][4]. Aamir Masood, a retired Pakistani air marshal who continues to be briefed on air force matters, described the agreement as a "done deal"[1][2][3][4].

The weapons package may also include Super Mushshak training aircraft and possibly JF-17 fighters developed jointly with China, though Masood did not provide figures or a delivery schedule[1][2][4]. Pakistan's military and defense ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment, nor did a spokesman for Sudan's army[1][4].</description>

      <description>Chinese AI startup DeepSeek plans to launch its next-generation V4 model in mid-February, according to a report from The Information, as the company extends its reach in developing nations despite security concerns from Western governments[1][2][3][4].

Internal tests by DeepSeek employees suggest V4 could outperform rivals including Anthropic's Claude and OpenAI's GPT series in coding tasks, The Information reported Friday, citing people familiar with the matter[1][2][4]. The model has also achieved breakthroughs in processing extremely long coding prompts, potentially offering developers working on complex software projects a new advantage[1][3][4].</description>

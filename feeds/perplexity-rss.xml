      <title>Xi declares Taiwan reunification 'unstoppable'</title>
      <link>https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/887a5eee-0b56-4b22-bf9b-c5cea9bc2576</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/xi-reaffirms-chinas-claim-taiwan-142538148.html" alt="featured"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese President Xi Jinping declared Wednesday that Taiwan's reunification with China is "unstoppable," capping off 2025 with a forceful message about the self-ruled island's future. In his annual New Year's Eve address, Xi said Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait share "a bond of blood and kinship," adding that "the reunification of our motherland, a trend of the times, is unstoppable"[1][2][3].

The remarks came one day after China's People's Liberation Army announced it had "successfully completed" Justice Mission 2025, a two-day military exercise that encircled Taiwan with warships, fighter jets, and missile forces[1][2][4]. Senior Captain Li Xi, spokesperson for the PLA's Eastern Theater Command, said the drills "fully tested the integrated joint operations capabilities" of Chinese troops[1][4].&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gold and silver post strongest gains since 1979</title>
      <link>https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/c9551a09-5e99-48e9-b0ab-860ad1d26f31</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/gold-silver-prices-soar-rcna251490" alt="featured"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold and silver are poised to end 2025 with their most impressive annual gains in more than four decades, despite sharp late-December selloffs that underscored the extraordinary volatility in precious metals markets.

Gold climbed approximately 66% this year, while silver surged over 150%, according to multiple market sources[1][2][3][4]. Both metals are heading for their strongest yearly performance since 1979, when the Iranian Revolution and runaway inflation drove gold up 126%[1][5][6][7].

The year-end rally turned turbulent in late December when CME Group raised margin requirements on precious metals futures twice within a week[8][9][10]. The exchange cited "market volatility to ensure adequate collateral coverage" as silver broke above $80 per ounce for the first time and gold approached $4,550[8][11]. Silver margins jumped approximately 30%, while gold requirements rose roughly 9%, forcing traders to post additional cash during one of the year's thinnest trading periods[12][10].

Silver plunged nearly 9% on Monday, December 29, to just above $73 per ounce after briefly exceeding $84 over the weekend[13]. Gold dropped more than 4% to around $4,355[13]. Both metals staged recoveries on Tuesday before falling again Wednesday, with silver declining more than 8% and gold slipping approximately 0.75%[13][14].&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Harvard scientist defends alien probe theory despite new images</title>

Fresh observations from the Hubble Space Telescope captured on December 12 and 27 reveal a stable double-jet structure streaming from the comet's nucleus, while separate imaging shows the object's outer coma is thinning naturally rather than through any intentional cloaking mechanism, according to International Business Times UK[1][2]. The object made its closest approach to Earth on December 19 at approximately 168 million miles, offering astronomers a final window to study the third confirmed interstellar visitor to our solar system[3][2].&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;img src="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-four-betting-ai-agents-134303480.html" alt="featured"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As 2025 draws to a close, artificial intelligence has fundamentally reshaped professional services and management roles, with the workforce racing to adapt through intensive reskilling as organizations prepare for even deeper transformation in 2026.

The Big Four professional services firms—Deloitte, EY, PwC, and KPMG—have deployed thousands of AI agents this year, setting a blueprint for how businesses worldwide will operate[1][2][3]. EY advanced 1,000 AI agents into development or production in 2025, with plans to scale to 100,000 by 2028[3][4]. PwC deployed 25,000 intelligent agents across client operations[4], while Deloitte's Zora AI platform reduced finance team costs by 25% and increased productivity by 40%[5][6].&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The dual deals underscore the chipmaker's aggressive expansion strategy as competition intensifies in artificial intelligence infrastructure, though both transactions face regulatory hurdles that could determine their ultimate success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Malaysia's Transport Ministry confirmed that the Armada 86 05 reached a designated search area with two autonomous underwater vehicles, reviving hopes of finally locating the Boeing 777 that vanished with 239 people on board on March 8, 2014[1][2][4]. The ministry did not disclose the exact location of the search zone, but stated the vessel prepared for operations at Fremantle Port in Western Australia[1][2].&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>China installs world's most powerful hypergravity centrifuge</title>
      <link>https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/61e1eb0c-3a49-43ec-8364-385f6ad3c3f6</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://interestingengineering.com/science/china-hypergravity-machine-record" alt="featured"&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has taken the lead in hypergravity research with the arrival of CHIEF1900, a centrifuge capable of generating gravitational forces 1,900 times stronger than Earth's gravity. Developed by Shanghai Electric Nuclear Power Group, the machine was delivered to Zhejiang University on December 22 and is currently being installed at the university's underground research facility in Hangzhou[1][2].

Once operational, CHIEF1900 will surpass all existing hypergravity centrifuges worldwide, including its predecessor CHIEF1300, which began operations in September with a capacity of 1,300 gravity-tonnes[1][3]. The previous world record was held by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers facility in Vicksburg, Mississippi, with a capacity of approximately 1,200 gravity-tonnes[1][4].&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trump shares editorial blasting Putin as Ukraine talks stall</title>
      <link>https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/7a0fea47-bb90-4527-82b4-25bc97805cf0</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-31/trump-shares-editorial-critical-of-putin-after-setback-in-talks" alt="featured"&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump on Wednesday signaled frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin by sharing a New York Post editorial that blames the Kremlin for obstructing peace negotiations in Ukraine[1][2]. The editorial, titled "Putin 'attack' bluster shows Russia is the one standing in the way of peace," was posted to Trump's Truth Social account without additional comment[3][2].

The public rebuke came hours before Putin delivered his annual New Year's address vowing victory in Ukraine, telling troops "we believe in you and our victory"[4][5]. The dueling messages highlighted the difficulties facing U.S.-led efforts to broker an end to the nearly four-year conflict, despite Trump's recent optimism that a deal may be within reach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-held-talks-with-ukraine-european-countries-next-steps-ending-ukraine-war-2025-12-31/" alt="featured"&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump's advisors held telephone discussions on December 31 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and national security advisors from the United Kingdom, France, and Germany to strategize on next steps in ending Russia's war in Ukraine, according to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff[1][2][3].

The talks, which included U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Ukraine's chief negotiator Rustem Umerov, focused on strengthening security guarantees, developing deconfliction mechanisms, and advancing a "prosperity package" for Ukraine's post-war recovery[1][2][4]. French President Emmanuel Macron announced that many European states and allies will make concrete commitments to protect Ukraine at a meeting in Paris on January 6[5][5].

"We focused on how to move the discussions forward in a practical way on behalf of @POTUS' peace process, including strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart," Witkoff wrote on social media[2][4].&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Artemis II mission is scheduled to launch no earlier than February 5, 2026, with launch windows open through the end of April, according to NASA officials[1][2][3]. The 10-day mission will send four astronauts—NASA's Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, along with Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen—on a lunar flyby[4][5]. The crew will become the first people to travel beyond low-Earth orbit since Apollo 17 in December 1972[1][4]. Glover will be the first Black man, Koch the first woman, and Hansen the first non-American to venture this far from Earth[6].&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>US says Ukraine did not target Putin in drone strike</title>
      <link>https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/c751b5ff-12ad-4c92-a6a5-a8d39b2a20d1</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-this-pool-photograph-distributed-by-the-russian-state-news-photo/2253168763" alt="featured"&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. national security officials determined that Ukraine did not target Russian President Vladimir Putin or his residences in a recent drone strike, contradicting Moscow's allegations and casting doubt on claims that threaten to derail peace negotiations.

The assessment, backed by the Central Intelligence Agency, found no evidence Ukraine aimed at Putin in the alleged December 28-29 incident, according to a U.S. official familiar with the intelligence[1][2][3]. The finding was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday[4][5].

Russia claimed on Monday that Ukraine launched 91 long-range attack drones at Putin's Valdai residence in the Novgorod region, calling it a "terrorist attack"[6][7][8]. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said all drones were intercepted and warned Moscow would revise its negotiating position[7][9][8]. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy swiftly dismissed the allegations as "another lie" intended to sabotage diplomatic progress[9][10].&lt;/p&gt;</description>

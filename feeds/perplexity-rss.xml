      <title>Nvidia unveils Rubin AI platform, robotaxi pilot</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/nvidia-surpasses-5-trillion-at-7m_2RWFhQ5.KRrWbuTnWxw</link>
      <description>Nvidia used its CES 2026 keynote in Las Vegas to argue that the next phase of artificial intelligence will be built less around chatbots and more around machines that can perceive, reason and act in the real world—while the company supplies the underlying compute stack.[1][2][3]

The presentation came after Nvidia’s historic run in 2025, when it became the first publicly traded company to top a $5 trillion market capitalization.[4][5][6] By early January 2026, its valuation had slipped back to roughly the mid-$4 trillion range, underscoring how quickly the numbers can swing even for the market’s biggest AI beneficiary.[7][8][9]</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/2026-sees-surge-in-moon-missio-KxFVzVCWTPKr3236RDepbg</link>
      <description>NASA announced Friday that its Artemis II mission is less than two weeks away from rolling out to the launch pad, marking the first step toward returning astronauts to lunar orbit after more than five decades[1]. The announcement signals the beginning of what industry observers are calling an unprecedented year for moon missions, with at least five commercial lunar landers also targeting 2026 launches alongside NASA's flagship program[2].

NASA Press Secretary Bethany Stevens confirmed that the agency's Space Launch System rocket will move to the launch pad by mid-January, with a launch window opening February 6 and extending through April[1][3]. The mission will send four astronauts—NASA's Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Koch, along with the Canadian Space Agency's Jeremy Hansen—on a roughly 10-day journey around the moon[4][5]. It will mark the first time humans have traveled beyond low-Earth orbit since Apollo 17 in 1972[5][6].</description>

      <title>UN condemns US military operation in Venezuela</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/un-criticizes-us-intervention-wKZ3s8khTAm950ANwJy6ow</link>
      <description>The United Nations Human Rights Office issued a sharp rebuke Tuesday of the US military operation in Venezuela, warning that the intervention undermines international law and makes "all states less safe around the world."[1][2][3][4]

Speaking at a media briefing in Geneva, Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk, said the operation "violated a fundamental principle of international law" that prohibits states from using force against the territorial integrity or political independence of another state.[1][5][2] "It sends a signal that the powerful can do whatever they like," Shamdasani told reporters.[2][4][6]

The criticism follows the January 3 US military strike on Venezuela that resulted in the capture of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. More than 150 US aircraft bombed military installations across Caracas in the predawn operation, codenamed "Absolute Resolve," before special forces extracted Maduro from the Venezuelan capital.[7][8] Venezuelan officials reported at least 80 people were killed, including civilians.[8]</description>

      <title>One in five solar panels degrades twice as fast as expected, UNSW study finds</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/unsw-study-finds-20-percent-of-n5ni8eJ0T8uzqEg5PEng1Q</link>
      <description>Researchers at the University of New South Wales have uncovered a troubling pattern in solar panel performance, finding that approximately 20% of panels examined degrade much more rapidly than industry expectations, potentially lasting only half their anticipated 25-year lifespan.

The study, published in IEEE and released January 5, analyzed data from nearly 11,000 photovoltaic systems worldwide to investigate what scientists call the "long tail" problem—where a subset of panels fails far more quickly than the average degradation rate[1][2][3].

"Most solar systems are designed to last around 25 years, based on their warranty period," said Yang Tang, a PhD student at UNSW's School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering and co-author of the paper[1][3][4]. "For the entire dataset, we observed that system performance typically declines by around 0.9% per year. However, at least one in five systems degrade at least 1.5 times faster than this typical rate, and roughly one in 12 degrade twice as fast."

For operators of solar farms where hundreds of thousands of panels are installed, the findings represent a hidden financial risk that challenges the economic models underpinning the industry's growth[1][2][3].</description>

      <title>Japanese teams advance quantum computing with error correction breakthrough</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/japanese-teams-advance-quantum-tGtyiBrCRUOwSua_r_tj_g</link>
      <description>Japanese research teams are making parallel strides in quantum computing, with scientists at Institute of Science Tokyo achieving near-theoretical performance in error correction while RIKEN develops software to merge quantum computers with supercomputers.

A team led by Associate Professor Kenta Kasai at Institute of Science Tokyo has developed quantum error-correction codes that approach the theoretical limit known as the hashing bound, according to research published in npj Quantum Information[1][2][3][4]. The codes achieved a frame error rate as low as 10⁻⁴ for systems with hundreds of thousands of qubits, with decoding complexity that scales proportionally to the number of physical qubits—addressing a major barrier to practical quantum computing[1][2].

Traditional quantum error-correction methods hit an accuracy ceiling far below theoretical limits, requiring heavy computation that made large-scale systems impractical[1][2]. Kasai and Master's student Daiki Komoto constructed low-density parity-check codes defined over non-binary finite fields that handle both bit-flip and phase-flip errors simultaneously[3][5]. "Our quantum error-correcting code has a greater than 1/2 code rate, targeting hundreds of thousands of logical qubits," Kasai said[3][4]. The breakthrough could enable quantum computers to scale to millions of logical qubits, potentially advancing drug discovery, cryptography and climate prediction[1][6].</description>

      <description>China announced on Tuesday an immediate ban on all exports of dual-use items to Japanese military end-users, marking the latest escalation in a diplomatic crisis between Asia's two largest economies that has deepened since November[1][2][3].

The ban, issued by China's Ministry of Commerce, prohibits the export of goods with both civilian and military applications to any Japanese military users or for purposes that could enhance Japan's defense capabilities[1][2][3]. The ministry warned that organizations or individuals from any country that violate the restrictions will face legal consequences[4][5][3].

Dual-use items encompass a wide range of technologies and materials including semiconductors, drones, chemicals, laser systems, satellite communication equipment, and advanced computing devices—products that serve commercial purposes but can also be adapted for military applications[6][7][8].</description>

      <title>White House refuses to rule out force in Greenland push</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/stephen-miller-claims-greenlan-0MCtIvx6R7WXQCZwCs8mJw</link>
      <description>White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller asserted Monday that Greenland should become part of the United States, questioning Denmark's sovereignty over the Arctic territory and refusing to rule out the use of military force to acquire it[1][2]. The statements, made during a CNN interview, triggered sharp rebukes from European leaders who warned that such action would threaten the NATO alliance and upside decades of post-World War II security cooperation[3][4].

"Nobody is going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland," Miller said when pressed repeatedly about whether Washington would rule out military intervention[5][6]. He challenged Denmark's territorial claims, asking "by what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland?"[7][2]

The comments came days after a provocative social media post by Miller's wife, Katie Miller, who shared an image Saturday of Greenland covered in the American flag with the caption "SOON"[8][9]. The post followed closely on the heels of a U.S. military operation in Venezuela that captured President Nicolás Maduro, raising international concerns about the Trump administration's willingness to use force against sovereign nations.</description>

      <description>The United States has pledged to support a European-led multinational force in Ukraine and lead ceasefire monitoring efforts under binding security commitments finalized at a Paris summit Tuesday, marking a significant shift in Western policy toward preventing future Russian aggression.

Draft statements from the gathering of the "Coalition of the Willing" indicate Washington will head a "continuous, reliable ceasefire monitoring system" with international participation following any peace agreement[1][2][3][4]. The US will also provide intelligence and logistics support to European forces deployed in Ukraine and commit to backing them "in case of attack" by Russia[1][2][3].

French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting representatives from 35 countries, including 27 heads of state, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, at the Élysée Palace[5][6][7]. The meeting aims to finalize contributions to security guarantees that Ukraine requires to deter further Russian aggression after nearly four years of war.</description>

      <title>Israel opens bidding for West Bank settlement to split territory</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/israel-approves-settlement-pro-TZ8E6gE0Ql6z3Id0og8rTA</link>
      <description>Israel has published a government tender seeking bids from developers to construct a settlement project near Jerusalem that would effectively divide the West Bank into northern and southern sections, marking the final step before construction begins on the long-frozen initiative.

The tender, posted on Israel's Land Authority website, calls for proposals to develop 3,401 housing units in the E1 area, an open tract of land east of Jerusalem[1][2][3]. The anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now first reported the tender. Yoni Mizrahi, who runs the group's settlement watch division, said initial work could begin within the month[1][2][4].

The move follows Israel's final approval of the E1 project in August 2025, when the Higher Planning Council validated plans after rejecting all objections[5][6]. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right politician who oversees settlement policy, has championed the project. "The Palestinian state is being erased from the table not with slogans but with actions," he said when Israel gave final approval to the plan in August[3][7]. "Every settlement, every neighborhood, every housing unit is another nail in the coffin of this dangerous idea."</description>

      <description>Iran's government announced Monday it will distribute a monthly payment of approximately $7 to citizens in an attempt to quell nationwide protests that have left at least 35 people dead and sparked warnings from President Donald Trump.

Government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said the payments, worth one million tomans, would begin January 10 and aim to "preserve households' purchasing power, curb inflation, and ensure food security"[1][2]. The stipend represents a shift from $10 billion in annual import subsidies toward direct cash assistance, though the amount can buy only about 100 eggs, one kilogram of red meat, or several kilograms of rice at current prices[3][4].</description>

      <description>The world's leading chipmakers converged on Las Vegas this week to unveil their latest artificial intelligence computing platforms at CES 2026, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang declaring the arrival of "physical AI"—artificial intelligence that can understand and act in the real world[1][2][3].

Nvidia announced its Vera Rubin platform, a six-chip AI supercomputer now in full production and expected to ship in the second half of 2026[2][4][5]. The platform claims to deliver five times more AI training performance than its Blackwell predecessor while reducing inference token costs by tenfold[6][7]. Huang also introduced Alpamayo, an open-source autonomous driving AI model trained on 1,700 hours of driving data, which Mercedes-Benz will integrate into its upcoming CLA model[3][8][9].

AMD, not to be outdone, showcased its massive Helios rack-scale platform at CEO Lisa Su's keynote. The system weighs 7,000 pounds—equivalent to two compact cars—and houses 72 MI455X GPUs delivering up to 2.9 exaflops of AI inference performance[10][11][12]. The company also unveiled its Ryzen AI 400 series processors for laptops, featuring up to 60 TOPS of AI computing power and set to launch in the first quarter of 2026[10][13][14].

Intel countered with its Core Ultra Series 3 processors, branded Panther Lake, marking the first AI PC platform built on the company's 18A process technology and manufactured in the United States[15][16][17]. The chips will power over 200 PC designs from global partners, with consumer laptops available starting January 27[15][16]. Intel claims up to 180 platform TOPS and promises more than 50 percent faster CPU performance compared to previous generations[16][18].</description>

      <description>Colombian President Gustavo Petro issued a stark warning to the United States on Monday, declaring he would take up arms to defend his nation's sovereignty after President Donald Trump accused him of cocaine trafficking and threatened military intervention[1][2][3][4][5].

"I swore not to touch a weapon again since the 1989 Peace Pact, but for the Homeland I will take up arms again," Petro wrote on X, referring to his past as a member of the M-19 urban guerrilla group[2][5]. The former rebel fighter, who became Colombia's first leftist president in 2022, warned that any attempt to detain him would "unleash the popular jaguar" of the Colombian people[6][2][5].</description>

      <title>Europa may lack energy to support life, study says</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/study-finds-europa-unlikely-to-u6zNYOMrSxedPdayP9PYQA</link>
      <description>A new study published this week suggests that Jupiter's moon Europa—long considered one of the most promising places to search for extraterrestrial life—may lack the underwater geological activity necessary to sustain organisms in its vast subsurface ocean[1][2][3][4].

Researchers led by Paul Byrne, an associate professor of Earth, environmental, and planetary sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, calculated that Europa's seafloor is likely too quiet to support life today[2][3][5]. The study, published January 5 in Nature Communications, concludes that the moon probably lacks tectonic motion, warm hydrothermal vents, or other underwater geologic activity that would provide energy for potential life forms[1][2]</description>

      <description>The world's largest technology showcase opened its doors in Las Vegas on Monday with a decisive pivot toward "physical AI"—systems that move, navigate, and operate in real-world environments rather than just processing data on screens. Chipmakers Nvidia, AMD, and Intel unveiled next-generation processors designed to power this shift, while robot manufacturers demonstrated machines that can finally tackle one of home automation's last frontiers: climbing stairs.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang kicked off the show by announcing the Vera Rubin platform, a next-generation AI superchip architecture now in full production that the company claims offers more than triple the speed of its current Blackwell chips[1][2]. The platform, named after astronomer Vera Rubin, combines six chips into what Nvidia calls "one AI supercomputer," with products expected to roll out from partners in the second half of 2026[2][3].

"The moment for physical AI has arrived—when machines start to comprehend, reason, and operate in the real world," Huang said during his keynote[4]. He also unveiled Alpamayo, an AI model for autonomous vehicles that uses vision-language-action models to handle unfamiliar driving scenarios[2][5]. Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius reported testing the Nvidia-powered system on public roads, driving for more than an hour through heavy traffic, with the vehicles expected to launch in the first quarter of 2026[2].

AMD CEO Lisa Su showcased the company's Ryzen AI 400 series processors for PCs, claiming 1.3 times faster multitasking and 1.7 times quicker content creation compared to competitors[6][7]. The company also detailed its forthcoming MI500 series data center GPUs, asserting they will deliver up to a 1,000-fold enhancement in AI performance compared to the MI300X GPUs[7]. Intel announced its Panther Lake processors, branded as Core Ultra Series 3, featuring up to 180 platform TOPS (trillions of operations per second) for AI acceleration and claiming more than 50% faster CPU and graphics performance versus the previous generation[8]</description>

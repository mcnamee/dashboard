      <title>Webb telescope solves mystery of how crystals form in icy comets</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/james-webb-reveals-helix-nebul-3btx4NZPQJGuu_UGLZ2BAQ</link>
      <description>The James Webb Space Telescope has delivered a striking one-two punch of cosmic discoveries this week, capturing the clearest infrared images ever taken of the Helix Nebula while also solving a decades-old puzzle about how crystals found in comets formed in the frozen reaches of space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NASA unveiled the new Helix Nebula images on Tuesday, offering an unprecedented look at one of the most photographed planetary nebulas in the sky. Located 650 light-years from Earth in the constellation Aquarius and often called the "Eye of God," the nebula has never appeared with such detail.</description>

      <title>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reaches rare opposition today</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/3iatlas-makes-rare-final-appea-49hOb2mtT6yE1FdP2ydmCA</link>
      <description>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reaches a rare and fleeting celestial alignment today, positioning itself directly opposite the sun from Earth's perspective and offering scientists a once-in-decades opportunity to study material from another star system before the enigmatic visitor departs forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 13:00 UTC on January 22, 2026, 3I/ATLAS will align to within just 0.69 degrees of the Earth-Sun axis—an exceptionally small angle that creates ideal conditions for what astronomers call an "opposition surge," a phenomenon that will cause the object to appear brighter and reveal more about its composition. Unlike typical cometary oppositions that last only hours, this alignment will keep 3I/ATLAS within two degrees of the axis for approximately one week.</description>

      <description>Russian President Vladimir Putin began late-night talks with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner at the Kremlin on Thursday, January 22, 2026, as diplomatic efforts to end the nearly four-year Ukraine war enter what negotiators describe as a final stretch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The meeting, which started shortly before midnight Moscow time, brought together three American representatives—Witkoff, Kushner, and newly appointed senior adviser Josh Gruenbaum—with Putin's team, including foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov and special envoy Kirill Dmitriev, according to the Kremlin's official account. A brief video released by Russian state media showed Putin shaking hands with the American delegation and inviting them to a long oval table.</description>

      <title>EU Parliament freezes U.S. trade deal over Trump tariffs</title>

      <description>European lawmakers have frozen work on an EU-U.S. trade agreement after President Donald Trump tied threatened tariffs on key U.S. allies to his push for greater U.S. control and access in Greenland, reopening a geopolitical dispute that had already rattled markets this week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The standoff escalated after Trump said he would impose new duties on eight European countries beginning Feb. 1 unless an arrangement was reached over Greenland—then reversed course in Davos, saying he would not use force and that a “framework” with NATO was in view, prompting a relief bounce in equities.</description>

      <description>Investments that help communities withstand drought and conflict—especially by boosting farm productivity and basic services—may also curb displacement pressures across Africa, according to a new peer‑reviewed study published in the journal Sustainable Development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research, led by Hyun Kim of Chungnam National University, analyzes African country- and grid-level data spanning 1995–2015 and finds that **stronger “adaptive capacity”** is associated with **lower migration during periods of drought or armed conflict**, acting as a buffer when shocks hit.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met for approximately one hour behind closed doors at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, with both leaders describing the discussions as productive amid signs of progress toward a potential end to the nearly four-year war with Russia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump told reporters the meeting was "good" and reiterated his message: "The war has to end." Zelenskyy described the talks as "productive and meaningful," thanking Trump for his efforts to "stop the bloodshed and bring the war to an end."</description>

      <description>New research has revealed that under high-emission scenarios, the Greenland Ice Sheet could largely disappear over the coming centuries, threatening to raise global sea levels by more than seven meters and reshape coastlines worldwide. Scientists warn that accelerating ice loss and newly identified feedback mechanisms may be pushing Greenland's ice toward a point of no return.</description>

      <title>Scientists revive 3.2-billion-year-old enzyme to study early life on Earth</title>

      <description>Researchers at the University of Wisconsin–Madison have resurrected a 3.2-billion-year-old enzyme and studied it inside living microbes, creating a new way to understand the origins of life on Earth and potentially recognize signs of life on other planets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The NASA-funded study, published in Nature Communications on January 22, uses synthetic biology to reverse-engineer modern enzymes and rebuild their ancient ancestors. The research team, led by Betül Kaçar, a professor of bacteriology, and Holly Rucker, a PhD candidate in Kaçar's lab, focused on nitrogenase, an enzyme essential for converting atmospheric nitrogen into a form usable by living organisms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We picked an enzyme that really set the tone of life on this planet and then interrogated its history," Kaçar says. "Without nitrogenase, there would be no life as we know it."</description>

      <title>Study finds AI image generators converge on 12 generic themes</title>

      <description>When artificial intelligence systems are left to create and interpret their own outputs, they converge on just 12 generic visual themes regardless of how diverse or creative the original prompts were, according to new research that provides the first empirical evidence of AI-driven cultural homogenization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study, published this month in the journal Patterns, demonstrates that generative AI systems naturally tend toward bland, commercially safe aesthetics when used autonomously—a finding researchers describe as "visual elevator music."</description>

      <title>US seeks to eliminate all restrictions on Greenland military access</title>

      <description>The United States is pushing to rewrite its seven-decade-old defense agreement with Denmark to remove all restrictions on its military presence in Greenland, according to people familiar with the negotiations, as American negotiators seek to satisfy President Donald Trump's demands for control over the strategic Arctic territory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The original 1951 agreement, which was amended in 2004, requires the US to "consult with and inform" Denmark and Greenland before making "any significant changes to United States military operations or facilities in Greenland." American negotiators now want to eliminate this language entirely to ensure the US faces no restrictions in its military planning, according to sources who spoke to Bloomberg on condition of anonymity.</description>

      <title>Gold nears $5,000 record as Trump announces naval fleet heading to Iran</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/gold-nears-5000-dollar-record-8C9PhkZISUeIV8FKqFjy3Q</link>
      <description>Gold surged to an unprecedented high just shy of $5,000 an ounce on Friday, as escalating geopolitical tensions and a weakening dollar propelled the precious metal toward a historic milestone. Spot gold rose to a record $4,967.48 per ounce, marking a nearly 15% gain since the start of 2026 and extending a rally that saw the metal climb roughly 64% last year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rally gained fresh momentum after President Donald Trump announced that a "massive" U.S. naval force is heading toward Iran, reigniting Middle East tensions that had briefly cooled following his retreat from Greenland tariff threats. "We have an armada. We have a massive fleet heading in that direction, and maybe we won't have to use it," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One returning from the World Economic Forum in Davos.</description>

      <description>The United States' takeover of Venezuela's oil exports has ensnared crude shipments that were servicing debt to China, setting the stage for a potential showdown between the two superpowers that could further complicate the South American nation's path out of default.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Around a tenth of Venezuela's $150 billion foreign debt pile is estimated to be loans from China that the OPEC member was paying in oil cargoes — until the US seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month. The Trump administration has announced that proceeds from Venezuelan oil sales will be directed to a Qatar-based account under Washington's control, potentially giving the US president substantial leverage over which creditors get paid and when.</description>

      <description>The Bank of Japan kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.75% on Friday, as expected, while raising its economic growth and inflation forecasts. The decision provided a stabilizing force for markets still recovering from a historic bond selloff earlier in the week triggered by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's snap election announcement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asian equities edged higher following the decision, with Japan's Nikkei 225 rising 0.2% to 53,800.28. U.S. futures also gained modestly, with S&amp;P 500 futures up 0.2%. South Korea's Kospi climbed 0.6%, trading just below the 5,000 milestone it crossed for the first time on Thursday.</description>

      <description>The world's largest island has found itself at the intersection of climate science and geopolitical rivalry as NATO allies scramble to respond to U.S. President Donald Trump's renewed push to gain control of Greenland, even as new research underscores the territory's irreplaceable role in understanding global warming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, Trump announced a "framework for a future deal" regarding Greenland after meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, stepping back from earlier threats of military force or punitive tariffs against European nations opposing his acquisition efforts. Yet the specifics of this arrangement remain unclear to its most important stakeholder: Greenland itself.</description>

      <description>In a hypothetical nuclear exchange involving the United States, Russia, and China, the vast Arctic territory of Greenland would sit directly in the crossfire. Its location—beneath the flight paths that intercontinental ballistic missiles would traverse between these nuclear powers—has made the semi-autonomous Danish territory a focal point of President Donald Trump's aggressive push to acquire it for his ambitious "Golden Dome" missile defense initiative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on January 21, Trump called for "immediate negotiations" to acquire Greenland, describing it as "this land on which we're going to build the greatest golden dome ever built." He added: "If there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice. Think of it: those missiles would be flying right over the centre."</description>

"We're going to have the military we want," he told Fox Business following the announcement.</description>

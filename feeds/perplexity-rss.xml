      <title>US, India clash over stalled trade deal</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/usindia-trade-deal-stalls-over-Zh3IIy_SRtmSM1EHOQzw8w</link>
      <description>A diplomatic rift has emerged between the United States and India over the reasons behind stalled trade negotiations, with Washington and New Delhi offering sharply different accounts of why a bilateral agreement remains elusive.

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick claimed Thursday that a trade deal collapsed because Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi failed to personally telephone President Donald Trump to finalize the agreement. Speaking on the All-In Podcast, Lutnick said India was given "three Fridays" to seal the deal but proved "uncomfortable" arranging the call[1][2][3][4]. "I said — You need to have Modi; it's all arranged. Modi must call the president. Yet, they were hesitant to do it," Lutnick said. "Consequently, Modi did not make the call"[1].

India swiftly rejected the characterization. Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters Friday that the two leaders spoke eight times during 2025 and that both nations have been "close to a deal" on multiple occasions[1][5][6]. "The characterization of these discussions in the reported remarks is not accurate," Jaiswal said, adding that India remains "interested in a mutually beneficial trade deal"[7][2][6].

The White House has not responded to Lutnick's comments[3][8].</description>

      <title>Gates warns AI could enable bioterror attacks</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/bill-gates-urges-policy-action-7VJDRlTHSh.qs86nu_qL5w</link>
      <description>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates issued stark warnings about artificial intelligence and climate change in his annual letter released Friday, calling on governments to address risks he says market forces alone cannot solve.

Gates warned that "an even greater risk than a naturally caused pandemic is that a non-government group will use open source AI tools to design a bioterrorism weapon," drawing parallels to his prescient 2015 TED talk about pandemic unpreparedness[1][2][3][4]. The billionaire philanthropist also highlighted job market disruption as AI's second major challenge, noting that "we're already starting to see the impact of AI on the job market, and I think this impact will grow over the next five years"[3][4].

The letter, titled "Optimism with Footnotes," comes as President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on January 7[1][5][6]. Gates emphasized that "without a large global carbon tax—which is, unfortunately, politically unachievable—market forces do not properly incentivize the creation of technologies to reduce climate-related emissions"[2][7][8].</description>

      <title>Iran cuts internet access as economic protests spread</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/iran-shuts-down-internet-amid-wVdZ4PwfRXOxYPUN7KS1Sw</link>
      <description>Iran severed internet and telephone access nationwide on January 8 as mass protests demanding an end to the Islamic Republic entered their second week, with at least 42 people killed and more than 2,200 arrested since demonstrations erupted over the country's collapsing economy[1][2][3].

The internet blackout began around 8:30 p.m. local time Thursday, just as demonstrators responded to a call by exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi for coordinated nationwide protests[4][5][6]. NetBlocks, an internet monitoring organization, confirmed connectivity had plummeted to approximately 1% of ordinary levels by Friday, effectively isolating Iran's 71.9 million internet users from the outside world[1][7][8]. "Iran is now in the midst of a nationwide internet blackout," NetBlocks stated on social media platform X, adding that the shutdown "hinders the public's right to communicate at a critical moment"[8].

The demonstrations, which began in late December with merchants in Tehran protesting the rial's freefall to over 1.4 million per dollar, have since spread to all 31 provinces and evolved into broader calls for regime change[1][3][9]. The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported that 34 protesters and eight security personnel have died, with injuries largely caused by live ammunition, pellet shots, and plastic bullets[2][3][10].</description>

      <title>Khamenei vows no retreat amid deadly Iran protests</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/khamenei-vows-no-retreat-as-pr-k9EcMHfBQmeI68HCKAi1yQ</link>
      <description>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei delivered his first public remarks on nationwide protests Friday, vowing the Islamic Republic "will not back down" and accusing demonstrators of acting as "vandals" and "mercenaries for foreign powers." The defiant address came as Iran remained largely cut off from the world amid a nationwide internet and communications blackout imposed to suppress the unrest.

Speaking before supporters in Tehran on January 9, the 86-year-old cleric said protesters were destroying public property "to please" U.S. President Donald Trump, whose hands he claimed were "stained with the blood of thousands of Iranians" killed during last June's 12-day conflict between Israel, Iran, and the United States[1][2][3][4]. "The Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of hundreds of thousands of honorable people. It will not back down in the face of vandals," Khamenei declared[5][1][3].</description>

      <title>Trump vows U.S. will take Greenland 'whether they like it or not'</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-escalates-threats-to-tak-sTE3EQzPSeOpEHLq2xyPlA</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump dramatically escalated his campaign to acquire Greenland on Friday, telling reporters at the White House the United States will obtain the Danish territory "the easy way or the hard way"[1][2][3] and declaring "we are going to do something on Greenland whether they like it or not"[4][2][3].

The threats mark the most aggressive push yet by Trump to seize the Arctic island, following his stark assertion to The New York Times this week that his power as commander in chief is constrained only by his "own morality"[5][6][7]. "I don't need international law," Trump told the newspaper Wednesday, dismissing international legal frameworks even as he acknowledged his administration must follow such laws, adding "it depends what your definition of international law is"[5][7][8].

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the administration is "actively discussing" various strategies to acquire Greenland[9][10][11], explicitly stating that "utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander-in-chief's disposal"[12][13]. Reuters reported that officials are weighing payments of $10,000 to $100,000 to each of Greenland's approximately 57,000 residents to encourage secession from Denmark[14][9][15], potentially totaling up to $6 billion[9][15].</description>

      <title>France reschedules G7 summit to avoid Trump UFC party</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/france-delays-g7-summit-to-avo-w2.bzEaRS22wDVjrEXkVmg</link>
      <description>France has postponed this year's Group of Seven summit by one day to prevent a scheduling conflict with a mixed martial arts event at the White House on June 14, which coincides with President Donald Trump's 80th birthday[1][2][3][4].

The annual gathering of world leaders in Evian-les-Bains, originally scheduled for June 14-16, will now take place June 15-17, according to two officials familiar with the G7's arrangements[1][2][5]. The date change was first reported by Politico on Friday and has been updated on the G7's official website[6][3][5].

June 14 marks Flag Day in the United States, Trump's milestone birthday, and the date he announced in October for a "big UFC fight" on the White House grounds as part of the nation's 250th anniversary celebrations[7][8][9]. UFC CEO Dana White confirmed to CBS News this week that preparations are complete, with approximately 5,000 spectators expected on the South Lawn and up to 85,000 more at a public viewing area on the nearby Ellipse[10][11].</description>

      <title>Superheavy rockets could slash space telescope costs</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/spacex-starship-and-blue-origi-G8zcylDmS5yC6zmLVZhDyg</link>
      <description>Recent successful launches of SpaceX's Starship and Blue Origin's New Glenn rockets are raising hopes among astronomers that a new generation of more affordable space telescopes could arrive years ahead of schedule, potentially ending a looming gap in space-based observations.

The two superheavy-lift vehicles achieved major milestones in late 2025—Starship's fully successful Flight 11 test on October 13 and New Glenn's second flight on November 13, which deployed NASA's ESCAPADE Mars mission and successfully landed its booster[1][2][3]. These achievements come as NASA faces an expected decade-long wait until 2045 or later for its next flagship observatory, creating what Martin Elvis, a senior astrophysicist at the Smithsonian Institution, calls "a forbidding timeline"[4][5].</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/iran-faces-widespread-protests-yLTgiCI_Tta7T53YN3GJBA</link>
      <description>Iran plunged into a nationwide internet blackout on Thursday as anti-government protests entered their thirteenth day, with authorities responding to the most significant unrest since the 2022 "Woman, Life, Freedom" movement[1][2][3]. Human rights groups report at least 42 people have been killed and more than 2,300 arrested since demonstrations erupted across all 31 provinces[4][5][6].

The internet shutdown came after exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi called for coordinated demonstrations at 8 p.m. local time on Thursday and Friday evenings[7][8]. Monitoring organization NetBlocks confirmed connectivity had dropped to 1% of normal levels by Friday, hampering communication and masking the scale of the crackdown[9][10].</description>

      <description>Indonesia on Saturday became the first country to block Elon Musk's Grok chatbot, citing concerns over the AI tool's ability to generate sexually explicit deepfake images of women and children without consent[1][2][3][4].

Communications and Digital Minister Meutya Hafid announced the temporary ban to "protect women, children, and the entire community from the risk of fake pornographic content generated using artificial intelligence technology"[2][3][4]. The minister characterized the practice of non-consensual sexual deepfakes as "a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space"[3][4][5], calling it a form of "digital-based violence"[1][6][7].</description>

      <title>Richest 1% exhausted 2026 carbon budget in 10 days, Oxfam says</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/richest-1-percent-exceed-2026-cheiYNomQ9e4KXbf2hwPXA</link>
      <description>The richest 1 percent of the world's population exhausted their annual carbon emissions allowance just 10 days into 2026, according to research released by Oxfam on January 10. The finding underscores growing concerns about climate inequality as governments face mounting pressure to impose wealth taxes and restrict luxury carbon consumption.

Oxfam designated January 10 as "Pollutocrat Day," the date when the wealthiest exceeded safe emission limits needed to keep global warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, as outlined in the Paris Agreement[1]. The analysis, using data from the Stockholm Environment Institute, found the richest 1 percent emit 75.1 tonnes of carbon dioxide per person annually, or 0.206 tonnes daily[1]. In stark contrast, someone from the poorest half of the global population would take nearly three years to use their carbon allowance[2][3].

The ultra-wealthy crossed this threshold even faster. The richest 0.1 percent depleted their annual budget by January 3, just three days into the new year[4][1].</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump intensified his push to acquire Greenland on Friday, declaring the United States will "do something on Greenland whether they like it or not," as the world's largest island becomes a flashpoint for geopolitical tensions over its vast mineral wealth and strategic Arctic position[1][2][3].

All five political parties in Greenland's parliament issued a unified rejection hours later. "We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders," the leaders stated in a rare joint declaration, announcing an expedited parliamentary session to address the escalating U.S. threats[2][4]. The island's 57,000 residents have consistently rejected Trump's overtures, with Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen reiterating that "Greenland is not for sale"[1][3].</description>

      <title>Astronomers reveal 'ghost galaxy' and platypus galaxies</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/astronomers-discover-mysteriou-FcFCo.KQS1GhHlS0CS6RIw</link>
      <description>Astronomers presented two groundbreaking discoveries this week at the 247th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Phoenix, unveiling celestial objects that challenge prevailing theories about how galaxies form and evolve.

Using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, researchers confirmed the first-ever detection of a starless dark matter cloud dubbed Cloud-9, located 14 million light-years from Earth near the spiral galaxy Messier 94[1][2][3][4][5][6]. The object represents a category called Reionization-Limited H I Clouds, or RELHICs—theoretical "failed galaxies" that never accumulated enough gas to ignite star formation[1][2][3][7][8][9].

"This is a tale of a failed galaxy," said Alejandro Benitez-Llambay, an astrophysicist at the University of Milano-Bicocca in Milan, Italy, who serves as the study's principal investigator[1][10][11]. The findings, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters in November 2025, were presented Monday at the conference[1][8][11].

Cloud-9's core spans roughly 4,900 light-years and contains about one million solar masses of neutral hydrogen gas[1][3][8]. Yet calculations suggest the cloud sits within a dark matter halo weighing approximately five billion solar masses—mass that provides gravitational structure without producing visible light[1][3][12].

"Cloud-9 gives us a rare look at a dark-matter-dominated cloud," said Andrew Fox, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute for the European Space Agency[1][3][13].

The discovery began three years ago when China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope detected the hydrogen cloud during a radio survey[1][2][3][4][14][15]. Subsequent observations from the Green Bank Telescope and Very Large Array confirmed the gas presence, but only Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys could definitively rule out stars[1][3][4][8][13].

"Before we used Hubble, you could argue that this is a faint dwarf galaxy that we could not see with ground-based telescopes," said lead author Gagandeep Anand of the Space Telescope Science Institute[3][13][12]. "But with Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys, we're able to nail down that there's nothing there."</description>

      <title>Venezuela frees 18 political prisoners after Maduro capture</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/venezuela-releases-political-p-qBE0PiADTwarTbJy6rWjow</link>
      <description>Venezuela has released 18 political prisoners as of Saturday morning, following the U.S. military capture of President Nicolás Maduro one week earlier[1][2]. The prisoner releases mark the first concessions by Venezuela's interim government since U.S. forces seized Maduro in a raid on Caracas on January 3[3][4][5].

President Donald Trump announced Friday that he had canceled a planned "second wave of attacks" on Venezuela after the country began freeing detainees[3][6][7]. "Venezuela is releasing large numbers of political prisoners as a sign of 'Seeking Peace,'" Trump wrote on Truth Social, calling it "a very important and smart gesture"[3][8][7]. Trump said the U.S. and Venezuela "are working well together, especially as it pertains to rebuilding, in a much bigger, better, and more modern form, their oil and gas infrastructure"[3][7].

Jorge Rodríguez, president of Venezuela's National Assembly and brother of interim president Delcy Rodríguez, announced Thursday that a "significant number" of prisoners would be released immediately as a gesture to promote "peaceful coexistence"[3][5][9]. He did not specify how many would be freed or provide names[3][4][5].</description>

      <description>Iran's Revolutionary Guards declared Saturday that safeguarding security is a "red line" as authorities escalated efforts to crush the largest anti-government protests in years, now entering their 13th consecutive day amid a nationwide internet blackout and mounting international pressure.

The warning from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, broadcast on state television, came as protests that began over soaring inflation on December 28 have evolved into calls for an end to clerical rule[1][2][3]. The elite force accused "terrorists" of targeting military and law enforcement bases and said continued unrest was "unacceptable"[1][4].</description>

      <description>The United States and allied forces conducted extensive airstrikes against Islamic State targets across Syria on Saturday afternoon, firing more than 90 precision munitions at over 35 locations in the second major wave of a sustained military campaign to retaliate for the killing of three Americans last month[1][2][3][4][5].

The strikes, carried out at approximately 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time, involved more than 20 aircraft including F-15E Strike Eagles, A-10 Warthogs, AC-130J gunships, MQ-9 Reaper drones, and Jordanian F-16s, according to U.S. Central Command[1][4]. The military operation is part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, authorized by President Donald Trump on December 19 in response to a deadly ISIS ambush near Palmyra that killed two Iowa National Guard soldiers and a U.S. civilian interpreter on December 13[1][2][3][5].</description>

      <description>SpaceX launched NASA's Pandora satellite Sunday morning from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, sending the first mission of NASA's Astrophysics Pioneers program to study the atmospheres of distant exoplanets[1][2][3].

The 716-pound satellite lifted off at 5:19 a.m. PST aboard a Falcon 9 rocket carrying about 40 payloads on the inaugural Twilight rideshare mission to sun-synchronous orbit[1][4][5]. The launch marked a new approach to exoplanet research, with Pandora designed to disentangle signals from planetary atmospheres and their host stars using simultaneous observations in visible and infrared light[2][6].</description>

      <title>Iran leader vows economic reform as death toll tops 160</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/pezeshkian-promises-economic-r-3lSIY0PpSwy_z0zF4_ilMA</link>
      <description>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian pledged to overhaul his country's struggling economy on Sunday while accusing the United States and Israel of orchestrating nationwide protests that have left more than 160 dead, according to multiple reports.

In a televised address, Pezeshkian struck a conciliatory tone, saying his government is "ready to heed the voice of its people" and is "determined to resolve economic problems by any means possible"[1][2][3][4][5]. However, he urged Iranians to distance themselves from what he called "rioters and terrorists," claiming foreign powers are exploiting legitimate grievances to destabilize the country[1][2][6].</description>

      <title>Iran warns US bases, Israel are 'legitimate targets'</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/iran-warns-us-and-israel-of-re-wldX4LVOT0CCnz.HUyzhfA</link>
      <description>Iran's parliament speaker issued a stark warning Sunday that American military bases across the Middle East and Israel would be considered "legitimate targets" if the United States launches strikes against the Islamic Republic, as President Donald Trump weighs military options to support anti-government protesters.

Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, speaking during a heated parliamentary session broadcast on state television, told lawmakers that Tehran would not limit itself to retaliatory strikes. "In the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centers, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets," he said, using Iran's term for Israel[1][2][3]. "We do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat."

As Qalibaf spoke, lawmakers rushed the parliament dais chanting "Death to America," marking a sharp escalation in tensions[1][4].</description>

      <title>Iran protest death toll exceeds 500 amid crackdown, rights group says</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/iran-protest-death-toll-exceed-yb.PM.8xTOSlZI49JWD3xg</link>
      <description>The death toll from two weeks of anti-government protests in Iran has climbed above 500, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, as authorities impose a nationwide internet blackout and threaten demonstrators with the death penalty.

HRANA reported Sunday that 490 protesters and 48 security force members have been killed since demonstrations erupted on December 28, with approximately 10,000 people arrested[1][2][3][4]. Reuters could not independently verify the figures, and Iranian authorities have not released official casualty counts[1][2][3]. Some reports suggest the actual toll may be far higher, with one Tehran doctor telling TIME that at least 217 deaths had been recorded across six hospitals in the capital alone[5].

Medical staff at hospitals in Tehran, Rasht, and Shiraz described facilities overwhelmed by the wounded and dead. A hospital worker in Tehran told the BBC that casualties were so numerous that "there wasn't enough space in the morgue; the bodies were placed on top of one another"[6][7]. Another medic reported security forces firing "direct shots to the heads of the young people, to their hearts as well"[6][7]. BBC Persian verified that approximately 70 bodies were brought to Poursina Hospital in Rasht on Friday night, exceeding morgue capacity[7][8].</description>

      <title>Britain weighs Greenland deployment as Trump threatens seizure</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/uk-and-europe-consider-militar-mn0Ler2kS4W8OED5nDdb9A</link>
      <description>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is weighing military options in Greenland following escalating threats by US President Donald Trump to seize the Danish territory, with UK officials pursuing an urgent diplomatic strategy to defuse the most serious NATO crisis in the alliance's history.

Trump declared Friday that the United States would "do something on Greenland whether they like it or not," refusing to rule out military force to acquire the semi-autonomous Arctic island[1][2]. The Daily Mail reported Sunday that Trump has ordered special forces commanders to draw up invasion plans, though senior military officials are reportedly resisting the directive as unlawful[3][4].

The Telegraph reported Saturday that military planners are developing proposals for a potential NATO mission to Greenland that could involve British troops, warships and aircraft[5][6]. Downing Street has held discussions with German and French counterparts in recent days about deploying forces to demonstrate that Europe can address Arctic security concerns, according to British officials[7][5].</description>

      <title>Unstable water cycle drove nearly 5,000 deaths in 2025, report finds</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/global-water-cycle-instability-ldJEiTDFTZi3ZVrZH1L52A</link>
      <description>Water-related disasters caused nearly 5,000 deaths, displaced 8 million people, and resulted in economic losses exceeding US$360 billion during 2025, according to a new international report that attributes these catastrophes to an increasingly unstable global water cycle driven by rapid warming.

The 2025 Global Water Monitor Report, released Sunday by researchers led by Professor Albert van Dijk at The Australian National University's Fenner School of Environment and Society, documents how shifts in rainfall patterns, atmospheric moisture, and temperature combined to amplify floods, droughts, and heat extremes worldwide[1][2][3].</description>

      <title>Heat waves overwhelm honey bees' ability to cool hives, study finds</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/extreme-heat-waves-threaten-ho-gxpKTbVdRLKJQyII_vnB4A</link>
      <description>A new study reveals that intensifying heat waves are overwhelming honey bees' natural ability to cool their hives, causing population declines that could threaten global pollination services. The research, published on January 12 in the journal Ecological and Evolutionary Physiology, is the first to assess how natural heat waves affect honey bee colonies' capacity to regulate temperature and maintain healthy populations.[1][2]

The findings arrive as commercial beekeepers across North America already face colony losses potentially reaching 60 to 70 percent in recent years, according to Washington State University entomologists, underscoring the urgency of understanding how climate change compounds existing threats to these critical pollinators.[3]</description>

      <description>The past week has marked a whirlwind of activity for SpaceX and NASA, with the successful launch of the Pandora exoplanet telescope followed by preparations for what will be the first medical evacuation from the International Space Station in its 25-year history.

NASA's Pandora mission lifted off aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on January 11, joining a rideshare flight that SpaceX dubbed "Twilight" for its destination in a dusk-dawn sun-synchronous orbit[1][2]. The 325-kilogram spacecraft, equipped with a 45-centimeter all-aluminum telescope, will study at least 20 known exoplanets over its one-year primary mission[1][2].</description>

      <description>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has overturned decades of scientific thinking about supermassive black holes, revealing that hot, dusty material near the Circinus Galaxy's central black hole is primarily feeding it rather than being expelled outward as previously believed.

The research, published Tuesday in Nature, includes what NASA describes as the sharpest image of a black hole's surroundings ever captured by Webb[1][2].</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-rich soil nearly doubles tropical forest regrowth, study finds</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/nitrogen-doubles-tropical-fore-YjK1oxPhRN2XDaSQty.r_g</link>
      <description>Tropical forests can recover at nearly double the pace if they have adequate nitrogen in their soil, according to research published Monday in Nature Communications that carries implications for global reforestation strategies and climate change mitigation efforts.

The study, described as the world's largest and longest nitrogen and phosphorus addition experiment of its kind, found that young forests grew back 95% faster on recently abandoned agricultural land and 48% faster in forests recovering for 10 years when nitrogen was added to the soil[1][2][3].

"Nitrogen is limiting how quickly young forests can regrow," said Sarah Batterman, senior author on the paper and ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies and University of Leeds. "When we added nitrogen to the soil, forests grew back almost twice as fast in the first 10 years. Faster growth rates mean faster absorption of carbon dioxide"[2][4].</description>

      <description>Chinese state media has declared the nation's science fiction-inspired aerospace concepts will become reality, signaling a shift in how Beijing frames its ambitions for air and space dominance. A CCTV military channel broadcast on January 10 repositioned the Nantianmen Project—a futuristic weapons program dating to 2017—from fantasy to attainable technology[1][2].

Military analyst Wang Mingzhi of the PLA Air Force Command College stated on the program that "whether it can be realized is no longer the question; we should ask what will be realized first."[1][3] The comments mark the first official framing of the concepts as genuine development targets rather than educational displays.</description>

      <description>Foreign ministers from Denmark and Greenland are set to meet US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the White House on Wednesday, as President Donald Trump intensifies threats to take control of the Arctic territory "whether they like it or not."[1][2] Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said the meeting was requested to "move this whole discussion into a meeting room where we can look each other in the eye."[1]

Trump has repeatedly framed the acquisition of Greenland as essential for US national security, citing concerns about Russian and Chinese activity in the Arctic. "We don't want Russia or China going to Greenland, which if we don't take Greenland, you can have Russia or China as your next door neighbor," Trump told reporters Friday.[3][4]</description>

      <description>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney arrives in Beijing on Wednesday for a four-day visit, the first by a Canadian leader in nearly a decade, as China's state media ramps up pressure on Ottawa to chart a foreign policy course independent of the United States[1][2][3].

The trip, scheduled for January 14-17, comes as Canada grapples with a trade war with its southern neighbor and the fallout from President Donald Trump's tariffs and repeated suggestions that Canada could become "the 51st state"[3][4]. China sees an opportunity to peel the longtime U.S. ally away from Washington, at least partially, through what Beijing calls "strategic autonomy"[2][5].</description>

      <title>Meta cuts 1,000 Reality Labs jobs, shifting focus to AI glasses</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/meta-cuts-1000-reality-labs-jo-n1tqivzMT_mnbtAbXSi7MQ</link>
      <description>Meta Platforms has begun notifying more than 1,000 employees in its Reality Labs division of layoffs, marking a decisive retreat from the virtual reality and metaverse ambitions that once defined the company's future. The cuts, announced Tuesday morning, represent roughly 10% of the 15,000-person division and will disproportionately impact teams working on VR headsets and Horizon Worlds, Meta's VR-based social network[1][2][3].

Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth informed affected employees via an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg, with resources being redirected toward AI-powered wearables and smartphone features[2][4]. The move signals an acknowledgment that Meta's costly metaverse vision—which prompted CEO Mark Zuckerberg to rename the company from Facebook in 2021—has failed to gain mainstream traction.</description>

      <description>The global solar energy sector faces a potential waste crisis as experts warn that panels installed during the renewable energy surge of the 2000s and 2010s are reaching the end of their lifespan, with current designs making repair and recycling nearly impossible.

According to new analysis published this week by Rabia Charef, Senior Research Associate in Circular Economy and Digitalisation at Lancaster University, the world could face up to 250 million tonnes of solar panel waste by 2050 if the industry fails to adopt new design practices[1][2][3]. The panels that powered the clean energy transition were built to withstand decades of harsh weather but were never designed to be repaired, refurbished, or disassembled.</description>

      <description>China Three Gorges Corporation has installed the world's first 20-megawatt offshore wind turbine in the waters off Fujian Province, marking a global milestone in renewable energy technology. The turbine was successfully hoisted and completed on Tuesday in a project that demonstrates China's growing dominance in the offshore wind sector.

The massive turbine, located more than 30 kilometers from the coast of southeast China, features three blades measuring nearly 150 meters in length that reach a height of 174 meters above sea level[1][2][3]. Once connected to the grid, the single unit is expected to generate over 80 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually—enough to power approximately 44,000 households[1][2].</description>

      <description>After three consecutive years of double-digit gains fueled by artificial intelligence enthusiasm, Wall Street is now grappling with mounting warnings that the AI-driven rally may face headwinds in the year ahead.

Mohamed El-Erian, the former co-CIO at PIMCO, issued a stark warning in an op-ed published Monday, cautioning investors that the "AI narrative is unlikely to prove strong enough to continue overshadowing other lingering uncertainties" as 2026 progresses[1][2]. The respected economist pointed to economic inequality, geopolitical turmoil, and fears of overvaluation as factors that could derail what he called a "rational bubble."[1][3]</description>

      <description>Iranian security forces have launched house-to-house searches across Tehran and other cities to seize Starlink satellite dishes, seeking to sever protesters' last remaining link to the outside world as a deadly crackdown enters its third week. The confiscation campaign comes alongside military-grade jamming that has disrupted up to 80% of Starlink traffic in the country since Tehran imposed a near-total internet blackout on January 8[1][2][3].

Over the weekend, authorities in western Tehran began raiding homes to confiscate Starlink equipment, according to Amir Rashidi, director of digital rights and security at the U.S.-based nonprofit Miaan Group. "This is electronic warfare," Rashidi told The Wall Street Journal, noting that operations have been most severe in protest hotspots and during evening gatherings[1][4]. Iranian forces have also deployed drones to patrol rooftops searching for Starlink antennas as part of large-scale confiscation operations[2].</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump is intensifying his campaign to bring Greenland under American control, with the White House confirming that all options—including military force—remain on the table. The push comes as prediction market odds for U.S. acquisition of the Arctic territory have roughly doubled over the past year, even as experts warn that Greenland's mineral riches may be largely inaccessible.

"We are going to do something on Greenland whether they like it or not," Trump declared last week, adding that while he would prefer to negotiate, "if that doesn't happen, we will pursue the hard way."[1][2]</description>

      <description>Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen categorically rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's push to acquire the Arctic territory, declaring on Tuesday that Greenland chooses to remain part of Denmark rather than join the United States.

"We are now facing a geopolitical crisis, and if we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark," Nielsen said at a joint press conference in Copenhagen alongside Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen[1][2]. The announcement marks a direct rebuff to Trump's escalating threats to take control of the strategic Arctic island.</description>

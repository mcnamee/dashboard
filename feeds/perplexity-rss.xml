      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/merz-and-modi-deepen-india-ger-qZcXDrRbSL2nUtfFvUvhog</link>
      <description>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday signed a series of agreements on defense, critical minerals, artificial intelligence, and education during Merz's first official visit to India, as both nations seek to reduce reliance on China and Russia amid shifting global alliances.

The two-day visit, taking place in Modi's home state of Gujarat, produced memorandums of understanding covering security cooperation, health sector collaboration, and the establishment of an AI innovation centre[1][2]. Modi announced visa-free transit for Indian citizens through Germany and invited German universities to open campuses in India as part of a new higher education roadmap[3][4].</description>

      <description>Astronomers have discovered a colorful, persistent shock wave around a dead star that defies all known explanations, revealing what scientists describe as a first-of-its-kind cosmic phenomenon.

The white dwarf star RXJ0528+2838, located approximately 730 light-years from Earth, is surrounded by a glowing bow shock stretching roughly 3,800 times the distance between Earth and the Sun. The discovery, published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy, has left researchers searching for answers to what they call a "mystery engine" powering the phenomenon[1][2].</description>

      <description>In a move that dramatically escalates competition for prime real estate in low Earth orbit, China has submitted plans to the International Telecommunication Union covering more than 200,000 satellites, according to ITU records released Sunday[1][2][3].

The filings, submitted in the final week of December 2025, dwarf any previous satellite constellation proposals and come just days after U.S. regulators approved an expansion of SpaceX's Starlink network[4][5].</description>

      <description>German energy company Uniper and India's AM Green Ammonia have signed a long-term binding offtake agreement for up to 500,000 tons per year of renewable ammonia, marking what the companies call one of the first large-scale green fuel supply corridors between India and Europe[1][2][3].

The agreement was exchanged Monday in Ahmedabad in the presence of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, underlining the deal's geopolitical significance as both nations seek closer collaboration on clean energy[2][4]. First shipments are expected as early as 2028 from AM Green's one-million-ton-per-year facility currently under construction in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh[5][6].</description>

      <title>Ancient galaxy was slowly strangled to death by its black hole</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/black-hole-starves-ancient-gal-YuAmvDzmQb.JMquXjFXvEQ</link>
      <description>Astronomers have identified one of the earliest "dead" galaxies in the universe, revealing that its central supermassive black hole killed star formation not through a violent explosion but through repeated cycles of heating and expelling gas—a process researchers describe as "death by a thousand cuts."

The study, published January 11 in Nature Astronomy, used data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) to examine a galaxy designated GS-10578, nicknamed "Pablo's Galaxy" after the astronomer who first observed it in detail[1][2][3].</description>

The announcement cemented Alphabet's position as Wall Street's second-most valuable company, surpassing Apple for the first time since 2019[3][4].

      <description>Britain's communications regulator Ofcom announced Monday that it has opened a formal investigation into Elon Musk's social media platform X over concerns that its AI chatbot Grok is being used to create and distribute sexualized deepfake images of women and children. The probe marks the first significant enforcement action under the UK's Online Safety Act targeting a major social media platform.

"There have been deeply concerning reports of the Grok AI chatbot account on X being used to create and share undressed images of people — which may amount to intimate image abuse or pornography — and sexualised images of children that may amount to child sexual abuse material," Ofcom said in a statement[1][2][3].</description>

      <description>Greenland's government announced on Monday that it will intensify efforts to ensure the Arctic territory's defense falls under NATO's framework, as US President Donald Trump doubled down on his ambition to acquire the island, refusing to rule out military force.

"All NATO member states, including the United States, have a common interest in the defence of Greenland," Greenland's coalition government said in a statement published on the Naalakkersuisut (government) website[1][2]. The move comes as Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that "one way or the other, we are going to have Greenland"[3].</description>

      <description>The most widespread protests in years have swept across Iran over the past two weeks, with hundreds killed as authorities impose a near-total internet blackout and security forces escalate their crackdown on demonstrators demanding an end to clerical rule.

As the digital blackout enters its fifth day, the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) reported Monday that at least 544 people have been killed, including 496 protesters and 48 security personnel, while more than 10,600 individuals have been detained since demonstrations began on December 28[1][2]. Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based monitoring group, said unverified reports suggest the actual death toll could exceed 2,000, with much of the violence obscured by the communications shutdown[2].</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-threatens-cuba-oil-cutof-s0KVvXeMRhygdRimMQuBpg</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump declared on Sunday that Cuba will no longer receive Venezuelan oil or money, demanding the Caribbean nation "make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE" in a Truth Social post that drew a fiery rebuke from Cuban leadership. The threat marks an escalation of pressure on Cuba following the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on January 3.

Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel responded defiantly on X, stating, "Cuba is a free, independent and sovereign nation. No one tells us what to do."[1][2] He added that Cuba "does not attack; it has been attacked by the U.S. for 66 years, and it does not threaten; it prepares, ready to defend the homeland to the last drop of blood."[3][4]

On Monday, Díaz-Canel stated there are "no conversations with the US government except for technical contacts in the area of migration," while expressing openness to dialogue "founded on principles of sovereign equality, mutual respect, adherence to international law."[5][6]</description>

      <description>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi declared Monday that Tehran is "fully prepared for war" but remains open to diplomacy with the United States, as President Donald Trump considers military intervention over the Iranian government's deadly crackdown on nationwide protests.

"The Islamic Republic of Iran is not seeking war but is fully prepared for war," Araghchi told a conference of foreign ambassadors in Tehran, broadcast on state television[1][2]. "We are also ready for negotiations, but these negotiations should be fair, with equal rights and based on mutual respect."

The statement came hours after Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday that Iranian leaders had called him seeking to negotiate and that "a meeting is being set up"[3][4]. However, Trump warned the U.S. "may have to act before a meeting" due to the escalating violence against protesters.</description>

      <description>The White House is considering Iran's proposal to enter nuclear negotiations even as President Donald Trump leans toward authorizing military strikes against the Islamic Republic, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter[1][2].

Trump announced Sunday that Iran had reached out to the United States the previous day proposing to negotiate a nuclear agreement[2][3]. "Iran reached out because they want to talk," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One[3]. The President indicated his administration was working to arrange a meeting with Tehran but warned he might need to take action beforehand as the death toll from protests continues to rise[3].

The overture arrives amid a brutal crackdown on nationwide demonstrations that erupted December 28 following the Iranian rial's collapse to a record low of 1.4 million to the dollar[4][5][6]. At least 538 people have been killed in the two-week uprising, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which has a history of accuracy during previous unrest in Iran[4][7]. More than 10,600 individuals have been arrested[7].</description>

      <title>Trump to meet Venezuelan opposition leader Machado at White House</title>

      <description>Venezuela's interim government announced on Monday the release of 116 political prisoners, though human rights organizations have only been able to verify roughly half that number. The releases come after U.S. pressure following the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro by American forces earlier this month.

The discrepancy highlights ongoing tensions between the interim government's claims and the reality on the ground. The Penitentiary Services Ministry stated that those freed had been "deprived of their liberty for acts associated with disrupting the constitutional order and undermining the stability of the nation."[1][2] However, the human rights group Foro Penal reported that only 41 prisoners had been released as of Monday, including 24 freed overnight.[3][4] Another watchdog, Justicia, Encuentro y Perdón, confirmed 53 "duly verifiable" releases and called the current pace "clearly inadequate."[5][6]</description>

The 4-mile journey from the Vehicle Assembly Building will mark a critical milestone for Artemis II, the first crewed mission to the Moon since Apollo 17 in December 1972. If all goes according to plan, four astronauts could be launched toward the Moon as early as February 6[2][4].</description>

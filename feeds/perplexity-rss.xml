      <title>China installs world's first 20 MW offshore wind turbine</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/china-installs-world-s-first-2-OdWB7UMBTWy3USsrmu9WIA</link>
      <description>China Three Gorges Corporation has installed the world's first 20-megawatt offshore wind turbine in the waters off Fujian Province, marking a global milestone in renewable energy technology. The turbine was successfully hoisted and completed on Tuesday in a project that demonstrates China's growing dominance in the offshore wind sector.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The massive turbine, located more than 30 kilometers from the coast of southeast China, features three blades measuring nearly 150 meters in length that reach a height of 174 meters above sea level. Once connected to the grid, the single unit is expected to generate over 80 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually—enough to power approximately 44,000 households.</description>

      <title>U.S. urges Americans to leave Iran as Trump cancels talks and backs protesters</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/us-orders-iran-evacuation-as-t-u4704cz2Rt._VIPviJ_lAw</link>
      <description>The United States issued an urgent evacuation order for all American citizens in Iran on Sunday as anti-government protests entered their third week, with President Donald Trump canceling diplomatic talks and warning Tehran that "help is on its way" for demonstrators facing a deadly crackdown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The State Department elevated its travel advisory to the highest level on January 12, telling Americans to "leave Iran now" and not to rely on U.S. government assistance for departure. With commercial flights suspended until at least Friday and a near-total internet blackout in effect, officials directed citizens to flee overland through Turkey or Armenia.</description>

      <description>After three consecutive years of double-digit gains fueled by artificial intelligence enthusiasm, Wall Street is now grappling with mounting warnings that the AI-driven rally may face headwinds in the year ahead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mohamed El-Erian, the former co-CIO at PIMCO, issued a stark warning in an op-ed published Monday, cautioning investors that the "AI narrative is unlikely to prove strong enough to continue overshadowing other lingering uncertainties" as 2026 progresses. The respected economist pointed to economic inequality, geopolitical turmoil, and fears of overvaluation as factors that could derail what he called a "rational bubble."</description>

      <title>Iran raids homes for Starlink devices as protest crackdown intensifies</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/iran-raids-homes-to-confiscate-Yy8MA.GWRReuSZN.L0Uwjw</link>
      <description>Iranian security forces have launched house-to-house searches across Tehran and other cities to seize Starlink satellite dishes, seeking to sever protesters' last remaining link to the outside world as a deadly crackdown enters its third week. The confiscation campaign comes alongside military-grade jamming that has disrupted up to 80% of Starlink traffic in the country since Tehran imposed a near-total internet blackout on January 8.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the weekend, authorities in western Tehran began raiding homes to confiscate Starlink equipment, according to Amir Rashidi, director of digital rights and security at the U.S.-based nonprofit Miaan Group. "This is electronic warfare," Rashidi told The Wall Street Journal, noting that operations have been most severe in protest hotspots and during evening gatherings. Iranian forces have also deployed drones to patrol rooftops searching for Starlink antennas as part of large-scale confiscation operations.</description>

      <title>Greenland chooses Denmark over US as Trump escalates push</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-eyes-greenland-amid-risi-qQXTUc05T0udATeNNtjJWQ</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump is intensifying his campaign to bring Greenland under American control, with the White House confirming that all options—including military force—remain on the table. The push comes as prediction market odds for U.S. acquisition of the Arctic territory have roughly doubled over the past year, even as experts warn that Greenland's mineral riches may be largely inaccessible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We are going to do something on Greenland whether they like it or not," Trump declared last week, adding that while he would prefer to negotiate, "if that doesn't happen, we will pursue the hard way."</description>

      <description>Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen categorically rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's push to acquire the Arctic territory, declaring on Tuesday that Greenland chooses to remain part of Denmark rather than join the United States.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We are now facing a geopolitical crisis, and if we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark," Nielsen said at a joint press conference in Copenhagen alongside Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. The announcement marks a direct rebuff to Trump's escalating threats to take control of the strategic Arctic island.</description>

      <description>Viruses sent to the International Space Station evolved in unexpected ways that could help scientists develop new treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections on Earth, according to research published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Biology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that microgravity aboard the ISS fundamentally reshapes how bacteriophages—viruses that infect bacteria—interact with their hosts. The findings suggest that space-based research could unlock new approaches to combating drug-resistant pathogens that threaten public health worldwide.</description>

      <title>Japan launches first deep-sea mission to mine rare earths</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/japan-launches-first-deep-sea-Wl9fOUWGS.SathNN1OiIeg</link>
      <description>Japan has embarked on a historic deep-sea expedition to secure its own supply of rare earth minerals, deploying the scientific drilling vessel Chikyu on Monday from Shimizu Port in Shizuoka toward waters near Minamitori Island, a remote coral atoll approximately 1,900 kilometers southeast of Tokyo. The month-long mission represents the world's first attempt to continuously extract rare earth-rich mud from a depth of 6,000 meters below the ocean surface—a technological feat that could reshape Japan's approach to sourcing materials critical to electric vehicles, electronics, and defense systems.</description>

      <title>U.S. files warrants to seize dozens more Venezuela oil tankers</title>

      <description>The U.S. government has filed court warrants to seize dozens more tankers linked to the Venezuelan oil trade, four sources told Reuters, as Washington moves to consolidate control over oil shipments in and out of the South American country following the capture of President Nicolás Maduro earlier this month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The U.S. military and Coast Guard have already seized five vessels in recent weeks in international waters that were either carrying Venezuelan crude or had done so in the past. The latest push to obtain additional warrants signals an expansion of the Trump administration's campaign to choke off Venezuela's oil exports and assert authority over a maritime trade it says is riddled with sanctions evaders.</description>

      <title>Trump vows US will control Greenland 'one way or the other'</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-pushes-for-us-control-of-lMaFYss.TFKe566a5dkZDA</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump has intensified his campaign to acquire Greenland, asserting that the United States will take action "one way or the other" to control the Arctic territory. The renewed push has sparked a diplomatic row with NATO ally Denmark and drawn skepticism from experts who say the island's mineral wealth remains largely inaccessible despite estimates of 1.5 million tons of rare earth elements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We are going to do something on Greenland whether they like it or not," Trump said Friday, arguing that U.S. control is necessary to prevent Russia or China from establishing a foothold in the region. The president has warned that without American intervention, Greenland would see "Chinese destroyers and submarines all over the place"—claims that Nordic intelligence officials and defense analysts have dismissed as unfounded.</description>

      <description>The death toll from Iran's largest anti-government protests in decades climbed to an estimated 2,000 on Tuesday, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), as President Donald Trump canceled diplomatic talks with Tehran and warned protesters that "help is on its way."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The casualty figures dwarf those from any previous unrest in the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution. HRANA reported that 1,847 protesters, 135 security personnel, and nine children were among the dead, with more than 16,700 people detained. An Iranian official separately confirmed to Reuters that approximately 2,000 people have been killed.</description>

      <description>Hundreds of previously undetected earthquakes are rattling Antarctica's Thwaites Glacier, while an international team of scientists aboard a Korean icebreaker struggles against harsh weather to drill into the massive ice sheet that could reshape the world's coastlines if it collapses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A study published in Geophysical Research Letters by seismologist Thanh-Son Phạm of the Australian National University detected 362 glacial earthquakes in West Antarctica between 2010 and 2023, with 245 of them occurring at Thwaites—nicknamed the "Doomsday Glacier" because its collapse could trigger catastrophic sea level rise. The earthquakes, caused by massive icebergs capsizing as they calve from the glacier, were largely missed by global seismic networks due to their low-frequency waves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It is a lot less stable and has been hit by hundreds of iceberg earthquakes," Phạm told Gizmodo, noting that the most prolific period of seismic activity between 2018 and 2020 coincided with an accelerated flow of the glacier's ice tongue toward the sea.</description>

      <description>Prominent research claiming microplastics have infiltrated human brains, arteries, and organs is facing serious scrutiny, with analytical chemists warning that many findings may be artifacts of contamination and false positives rather than actual plastic particles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The controversy, reported by The Guardian this week, has cast doubt on a body of research that had fueled growing public alarm about the health effects of plastic pollution. Seven studies have now been formally challenged by researchers publishing criticism in the same journals where the original papers appeared, while a recent analysis flagged 18 additional studies for allegedly failing to account for human tissue producing measurements easily confused with common plastics.</description>

      <description>China's automobile exports surged 21 percent in 2025 to exceed 7 million vehicles, propelled by booming overseas shipments of electric vehicles even as demand at home showed signs of strain, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers reported Wednesday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The figures underscore a pivotal shift for the world's largest automotive market: Chinese automakers are increasingly looking abroad for growth as fierce domestic price wars and waning consumer confidence weigh on local sales. Exports of new energy vehicles, including battery-electric and plug-in hybrid models, doubled from the previous year to reach 2.6 million units.</description>

      <description>Toyota Motor announced Wednesday it has increased its bid to take Toyota Industries private to ¥18,800 per share, up 15% from the original ¥16,300 offer made in June, caving to pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The revised tender offer, set to begin Thursday and run through February 12, values the forklift manufacturer at approximately ¥5.6 trillion ($35 billion). The increase represents a win for shareholder activism in Japan, where no entity has previously challenged a company of Toyota's magnitude.</description>

      <description>Researchers sealed ancient glacial ice from the European Alps in a purpose-built cave at Antarctica's Concordia Station on Wednesday, inaugurating the world's first sanctuary designed to preserve climate records from melting glaciers for centuries to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Ice Memory Foundation placed its first two ice cores, extracted from Grand Combin glacier in Switzerland and Mont Blanc in France, into a 35-meter-long cave dug approximately 10 meters below the Antarctic surface, where temperatures remain stable at minus 52 degrees Celsius year-round without any need for artificial refrigeration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"To safeguard what would be otherwise irreversibly lost... is an endeavour for humanity," said Thomas Stocker, a Swiss climate scientist and chair of the Ice Memory Foundation, which spearheaded the initiative.</description>

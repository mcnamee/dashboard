      <title>Huang calls robots 'AI immigrants' to address labor gap</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/nvidia-ceo-highlights-ai-robot-92nQ2d.nT52TXjeLVLDXUQ</link>
      <description>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang declared robots "AI immigrants" at CES 2026 on Tuesday, arguing that advanced robotics powered by artificial intelligence will address a mounting global workforce crisis while creating new employment opportunities. Speaking to 200 journalists and analysts at a Las Vegas hotel during the technology conference, Huang estimated the global labor shortage at "tens of millions" of workers due to aging populations and demographic decline[1][2][3].

"Having robots will create jobs," Huang said. "We need more AI immigrants to help us on manufacturing floors and do work that maybe we've decided not to do anymore"[1][2][3]. The leader of the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalization of roughly $3.5 trillion, dismissed fears that automation would eliminate human employment, instead predicting a "robotics revolution" that would boost economies and expand hiring[1][2][3][4].</description>

      <title>Iran army chief threatens preemptive strike after Trump warning</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/iran-army-chief-threatens-pree-J.Xf3QSHSIWxNfJjx0NqMA</link>
      <description>Iran's army commander warned Wednesday of potential preemptive military action in response to what he called threatening "rhetoric" from the United States, marking a sharp escalation as nationwide protests over economic collapse enter their second week[1][2][3].

Maj. Gen. Amir Hatami, speaking to military academy students, appeared to reference President Donald Trump's statement last week that if Tehran "violently kills peaceful protesters," America "will come to their rescue"[1][2][4]. "The Islamic Republic considers the intensification of such rhetoric against the Iranian nation as a threat and will not leave its continuation without a response," Hatami said, according to state-run IRNA news agency[1][2][3].</description>

      <title>US forces seize Russian-flagged oil tanker after Atlantic chase</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/us-pursues-russian-flagged-ven-e7V6Rra3R6yLQeMaq._OmQ</link>
      <description>US military and Coast Guard personnel successfully boarded the Marinera, a Russian-flagged oil tanker linked to Venezuela, in the North Atlantic on January 7 before Russian naval escorts could arrive, according to US officials[1][2][3]. The seizure caps a dramatic two-week chase across the Atlantic and marks a significant escalation in tensions between Washington and Moscow over Venezuela's shadow fleet oil trade.

The operation was conducted by US special operations forces using MH-6 Little Bird helicopters from the elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, with imagery released by Russian state media showing the aircraft operating near the vessel[1][4]. US officials confirmed that boarding personnel, including Coast Guard members, secured the tanker before Russian surface vessels and a submarine dispatched to escort it could reach the scene[1][5].</description>

      <title>Chinese software flags possible B-21 bomber flaws</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/china-finds-flaws-in-us-b-21-b-te_hNXqcQWe69BWf1pn.XA</link>
      <description>Chinese researchers have developed advanced simulation software that suggests potential aerodynamic and stability shortcomings in publicly available designs of the United States' B-21 Raider stealth bomber, according to a study published last month in a peer-reviewed aerospace journal.

The software system, called PADJ-X, was detailed in December 2025 by researchers led by Huang Jiangtao from the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre in a paper published in Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica[1][2][3][4]. Using the platform to analyze a B-21-type configuration with 288 parameters, the team found that aerodynamic optimization could increase the aircraft's lift-to-drag ratio by approximately 15 percent and improve the pitching moment from -0.2 to nearly zero, suggesting the current design may not achieve optimal stability for level flight[1][2][4].

The research comes as the B-21 Raider, built by Northrop Grumman, undergoes intensive flight testing at Edwards Air Force Base in California[4][5][6]. A second test aircraft joined the program in September 2025, marking what Air Force Secretary Troy Meink called "substantial momentum" for the sixth-generation stealth bomber[5][6][7].</description>

      <title>Morocco fossils illuminate split between humans, Neanderthals</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/773000-year-old-moroccan-fossi-2.BkisHTSjKasX5_P618xw</link>
      <description>Scientists unveiled Wednesday the discovery of 773,000-year-old hominin fossils in Morocco that may represent populations living near the evolutionary crossroads where modern humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans diverged—filling a critical gap in the African fossil record and reinforcing Africa as the birthplace of our species[1][2][3][4].

The fossils, published in Nature, were unearthed from Grotte à Hominidés, a cave at the Thomas Quarry I site near Casablanca[1][2][3]. An international research team led by Jean-Jacques Hublin of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany analyzed three partial jawbones—including one from a child—along with several vertebrae and teeth[1][2][5][6][3]. The remains display a mosaic of primitive features resembling Homo erectus and more modern traits seen in later humans[1][5][3].</description>

      <description>U.S. forces seized a second sanctioned oil tanker linked to Venezuela on Wednesday, conducting back-to-back operations in the Caribbean and North Atlantic as President Donald Trump escalates enforcement of his blockade on Venezuelan oil exports.

The M/T Sophia, described by U.S. Southern Command as a "stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker," was apprehended in a predawn operation in international waters of the Caribbean Sea[1][2]. The Panama-flagged supertanker had departed Venezuelan waters in early January, operating with its transponder turned off in "dark mode" as part of a fleet carrying Venezuelan oil to China[3][4][5].</description>

      <title>Study finds aviation emissions could be cut by up to 75%</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/study-finds-aviation-emissions-q2uwe4JlSWipY0MS5WqrQw</link>
      <description>Global aviation emissions could be reduced by 50 to 75 percent through three efficiency strategies already within reach: deploying the most fuel-efficient aircraft, eliminating premium cabin seating, and filling more seats on each flight, according to a study published Tuesday in Nature Communications Earth &amp; Environment[1][2][3].

The research, co-led by the University of Oxford and Linnaeus University, analyzed more than 27 million commercial flights in 2023, revealing that airlines could achieve an 11 percent reduction in emissions immediately by better allocating their existing efficient aircraft on routes they already operate[1][2][3].

"Our results clearly show that efficiency-focused policy could swiftly reduce aviation emissions by more than half, without reducing flight numbers or waiting for future fuels," said co-author Dr. Milan Klöwer of Oxford's Department of Physics[2][3]. "These are tools that we can use right now."</description>

      <title>Interstellar comet releases water far from sun</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/interstellar-comet-3iatlas-sho-b4ndjZ_ERcijL3zxnRaB9A</link>
      <description>Astronomers have confirmed that the rare interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, not an alien spacecraft, following the most comprehensive radio signal search ever conducted on an object from beyond the solar system. The confirmation comes as new observations reveal the comet is releasing water at extraordinary rates and may be among the oldest objects ever observed, potentially dating back 7 to 14 billion years[1][2][3].

Results published this week from the Breakthrough Listen initiative show that multiple radio telescopes, including the Green Bank Telescope, detected no artificial signals during observations conducted as the comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025[1][4]. The Green Bank facility, the world's largest fully-steerable radio telescope, ruled out transmitters down to 0.1 watts—ten times weaker than a typical cell phone—during observations on December 18[1][5][6].</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/coalition-of-willing-summit-pr-dT_oHcNmTy.wbgf00yb_ww</link>
      <description>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed "concrete results" from a historic Paris summit where over 30 nations agreed to provide robust security guarantees in the event of a ceasefire with Russia, though critical issues including territorial disputes remain unresolved[1][2][3][4].

At Tuesday's Coalition of the Willing meeting, France and the United Kingdom signed a declaration committing to deploy troops and establish military hubs across Ukraine if a peace deal is reached[2][5][6]. French President Emmanuel Macron announced that Paris could deploy "several thousand" troops to monitor the Russia-Ukraine border and help regenerate Ukrainian armed forces, emphasizing these would not be combat forces[7][8][9].

The summit marked the first time the United States directly backed the coalition's security framework, with US envoy Steve Witkoff declaring that President Donald Trump "strongly, strongly stands behind security protocols"[2][10][11]. The American delegation, which included Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, reported "significant progress on several critical workstreams, including our bilateral security guarantee framework"[1][12][13].</description>

      <title>EU to suspend fertiliser tariffs and carbon levy</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/eu-considers-tariff-changes-an-Vf75zFH_SACVvNvIAugkCw</link>
      <description>The European Commission announced measures Wednesday to temporarily suspend tariffs and carbon levies on fertiliser imports following pressure from France and Italy to ease costs for struggling farmers.

EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic told agriculture ministers at a meeting in Brussels that the Commission will propose to temporarily suspend remaining most favored nation tariffs on ammonia, urea and other fertilisers[1][2]. The tariffs currently stand at 6.5% for ammonia and 5.5% for urea[1]. Additionally, the Commission will issue guidance allowing temporary suspension of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism on fertilisers, retroactive to January 1, 2026[3][4][5].

"Keeping fertilisers affordable is vital for farmers' incomes and Europe's food security," Sefcovic said at a press conference[1]. "While prices have stabilised, fertiliser costs remain around 60% higher than in 2020 and that is simply not sustainable."[1]</description>

      <description>Researchers have identified poison residues on 60,000-year-old arrowheads from South Africa, marking the earliest direct evidence of humans using poisoned weapons and pushing back this hunting practice by more than 50,000 years, according to a study published Tuesday in Science Advances[1][2][3].

The discovery at Umhlatuzana Rock Shelter in KwaZulu-Natal province reveals that early *Homo sapiens* possessed sophisticated knowledge of plant toxins and advanced cognitive abilities far earlier than previously documented[1][2][3]. Before this finding, the oldest confirmed poisoned arrows dated to approximately 7,000 years ago during the mid-Holocene period[1][4][5].</description>

Secretary of State Marco Rubio told lawmakers during a classified briefing this week that purchasing the territory is the administration's preferred approach, though he plans to meet with Danish officials next week after they requested an urgent meeting[2][4].

The renewed push comes as Trump frames Greenland as essential to U.S. national security, citing increased Russian and Chinese activity in the Arctic region[5][3]. Denmark, Greenland, and seven European nations have strongly rejected the proposal, with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warning that any military action would "mark the end of NATO"[6].</description>

      <title>Clean energy shift could save $12T by 2050, Oxford finds</title>

      <description>Australian farmer Brent Finlay stands beneath 45 towering wind turbines on his Queensland property, contemplating a remarkable transformation. Five years ago, a catastrophic drought turned his fertile land to dust, killing thousands of native kangaroos and forcing him to reconsider the future of his century-old family farm. Today, those same fields host part of the massive MacIntyre Wind Farm, generating power for 700,000 homes—and providing Finlay with crucial supplemental income as agriculture grows increasingly unpredictable[1][2].

His story reflects a broader economic shift gaining momentum worldwide. As renewable energy costs continue their precipitous decline, a rapid transition away from fossil fuels has emerged as not just an environmental imperative, but an enormous economic opportunity. According to a University of Oxford study, transitioning to renewable energy by 2050 could save the global economy at least $12 trillion in energy system costs compared to maintaining current fossil fuel use[3][4][5].</description>

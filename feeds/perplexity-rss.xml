      <title>Restoring coral reefs could boost seafood yields 50%</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/restoring-coral-reefs-could-fe-WX0.t26JSGub4K1LcbZ3wQ</link>
      <description>Allowing overfished coral reef populations to recover could boost sustainable seafood yields by nearly 50 percent and help feed millions worldwide, according to research published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences[1][2][3].

Scientists at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama and collaborators analyzed 1,211 reef sites across 23 jurisdictions, finding that depleted fish stocks produce far less food than their sustainable potential[4][5]. The study, led by Jessica Zamborain-Mason of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, calculated that recovery could generate between 20,000 and 162 million additional sustainable fish servings per country annually—enough to meet recommended seafood intake for up to 1.4 million additional people per year[6][1][5].

"Our study quantifies how much is being lost by having overfished reef fish communities in terms of food provisioning and, in turn, how much could be gained from rebuilding reef fish stocks and managing them at sustainable levels," Zamborain-Mason said[6][1][4].</description>

      <title>Trump says U.S. 'absolutely needs' Greenland</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-reaffirms-greenland-anne-.SkSv3inRRWdO8mYSm97Tw</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump on Sunday reaffirmed his intention to acquire Greenland, telling The Atlantic magazine "we absolutely need Greenland" for national security, describing the island as surrounded by Russian and Chinese ships[1][2]. The renewed pressure on Denmark came just hours after a controversial U.S. military operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, sparking fears among European allies that Trump's expansionist rhetoric could extend to the Arctic territory.

The timing amplified diplomatic tensions when Katie Miller, wife of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, posted an image of Greenland draped in the American flag on social media late Saturday with a single word: "SOON"[3][4][5]. Denmark's ambassador to the United States, Jesper Moeller Soerensen, responded swiftly, declaring his country expects "full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark"[3][4].</description>

      <title>Rubio softens Trump claim US will 'run' Venezuela</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-says-us-will-run-venezue-gRCQ.cW.TI2QlpSFHioqwg</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump announced Saturday that the United States would temporarily "run" Venezuela following the capture of President Nicolás Maduro in a dramatic overnight military operation, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared to soften that stance on Sunday, suggesting Washington would use oil leverage rather than govern the country directly[1][2].

Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were seized from their home in Caracas early Saturday during a raid by U.S. special forces and transported to New York, where they are being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn ahead of a Monday court appearance on narco-terrorism charges[3][4]. Trump told reporters the U.S. would "run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition"[3][1].

Yet on Sunday morning talk shows, Rubio walked back those assertions. "People keep fixating on that," he told NBC's "Meet the Press," clarifying that the U.S. would continue enforcing an oil quarantine to press for policy changes rather than governing Venezuela day-to-day[1][2]. "We expect to see changes in Venezuela," Rubio said, adding the U.S. would use control of sanctioned oil as "tremendous leverage"[2].</description>

      <title>Danish PM tells Trump to stop threatening Greenland annexation</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/denmark-urges-trump-to-stop-th-hd988wd7TVaUn75rhqmozA</link>
      <description>Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen issued a forceful rebuke to President Donald Trump on Sunday, demanding that the United States cease threats to annex Greenland following renewed American interest in the Danish territory in the wake of the U.S. military operation in Venezuela.

"It makes absolutely no sense to talk about the need for the United States to take over Greenland," Frederiksen said in a statement Sunday[1][2][3][4]. "The U.S. has no right to annex any of the three nations in the Danish kingdom."

The sharp exchange between NATO allies came after Trump told The Atlantic in an interview published Sunday that "we do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defense"[1][5][4]. His comments followed a major U.S. military operation early Saturday that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in Caracas[4][6][7].</description>

      <title>Oil prices dip modestly after US captures Venezuelan leader</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/us-seizure-of-venezuela-spurs-HzXMFuwjRTuVi5oQNKqXeA</link>
      <description>Oil prices edged lower on Sunday despite the weekend capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by US forces, as analysts said ample global supply would cushion any disruption from the oil-producing nation. Brent crude fell 22 cents to $60.53 per barrel, while US crude dropped 31 cents to $57.01[1].

The modest market reaction followed President Donald Trump's announcement Saturday that the United States would control Venezuela until an orderly transition could be arranged, after executing what he called a "large-scale strike" on the capital Caracas in the early hours of January 3[2][3]. Trump emphasized that securing US investments in Venezuela's oil sector was a primary goal, stating American oil companies were prepared to invest billions of dollars to restore production[1].</description>

      <title>Venezuelan oil exports frozen after US captures Maduro</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/us-captures-venezuelan-preside-2kpkqp5OSySY11wixyWG6g</link>
      <description>In an operation President Donald Trump described as a display of overwhelming military power, US forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife early Saturday morning in Caracas, marking one of the most dramatic military interventions in recent American history[1][2]. The raid, dubbed Operation Absolute Resolve, has effectively paralyzed Venezuela's oil exports while raising questions about the lengthy timeline to revitalize the country's energy infrastructure.</description>

      <title>AI safety experts warn systems outpace safeguards</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/experts-warn-world-unprepared-XYIFtTycSaKLZXLaB_UVDw</link>
      <description>A chorus of AI safety experts and industry leaders is warning that the world may lack the time and infrastructure to manage the rapidly escalating risks posed by artificial intelligence, as new autonomous systems outpace existing safeguards.

David Dalrymple, an AI safety expert at the UK government's Advanced Research and Invention Agency, told The Guardian this week that AI development is moving "really fast" and that it cannot be assumed these "systems are reliable"[1]. His warning echoes concerns from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who stated in early January that AI is becoming increasingly "dangerous" not because it is inherently malicious, but because its capabilities are advancing faster than the systems designed to control them[2][3].</description>

      <title>Trump says military operation against Colombia 'sounds good'</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-threatens-military-opera-jUCIrsEkQreCs.BO2is5kw</link>
      <description>U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday that a military operation against Colombia "sounds good to me," hours after threatening the country's leader to "watch his ass" following the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro[1][2][3][4].

The remarks, made as Trump returned from Florida, represent an escalation of tensions with Colombian President Gustavo Petro and raised alarm across Latin America that Washington's military intervention in the region may expand beyond Venezuela. Secretary of State Marco Rubio separately suggested Cuba could be the next target, describing the Cuban government as "a huge problem" and saying they are "in a lot of trouble"[5][6][7].</description>

      <description>As professional observatories tracked an ancient visitor from beyond our solar system, a Portland amateur astronomer achieved what many scientists struggle to capture: a clear image showing the distinct separation between the comet's nucleus and its tail.

Patrick Finney photographed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in early January using a consumer smart telescope from his backyard, documenting the rare celestial object as it departs after a months-long journey through the solar system[1][2]. The comet, only the third interstellar object ever detected, made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, passing at a distance of 270 million kilometers[1][2][3]. It remained invisible to the naked eye throughout its visit.</description>

      <title>Venezuela's acting president proposes US cooperation</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/venezuela-rodriguez-shifts-ton-Uj8huSpzS9a22RVjSk4.sw</link>
      <description>Venezuelan acting President Delcy Rodriguez made a notable shift in tone on Sunday, extending an invitation to the United States for a "cooperation agenda" just one day after condemning Washington's military operation that captured President Nicolás Maduro.

Rodriguez, who was named acting president by Venezuela's Supreme Court on Saturday following Maduro's detention, called for a "balanced and respectful relationship" between the two nations in a statement posted on Telegram[1][2][3]. "We extend an invitation to the US government to work together on an agenda for cooperation that is aimed toward shared development," she wrote, emphasizing that such cooperation should occur "within the framework of international law."[4][5]

Addressing President Donald Trump directly, Rodriguez said Venezuelans "deserve peace and dialogue, not war," adding that "this has always been the principle championed by President Maduro."[6][7][8] The statement marked a dramatic departure from her televised address on Saturday, when she surrounded herself with military leaders and declared "there is only one president in this country, and his name is Nicolás Maduro," while condemning the US operation as "barbaric."[9][10][11]</description>

      <title>Samsung to double Gemini-equipped devices to 800M</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/samsung-to-double-gemini-ai-de-wWzDbpA2R4Cn0Rf83iSL1A</link>
      <description>Samsung Electronics plans to double the number of its mobile devices equipped with Google's Gemini AI features to 800 million units this year, co-CEO TM Roh told Reuters in an exclusive interview, marking a major escalation in the global artificial intelligence race. The South Korean tech giant, which deployed Gemini-backed AI features to approximately 400 million smartphones and tablets by the end of 2025, aims to apply AI "to all products, all functions, and all services as quickly as possible," Roh said[1][2][3][4].

The aggressive expansion gives Google a significant advantage as the world's largest Android device manufacturer deepens its AI partnership. Samsung is striving to reclaim its market leadership from Apple, which Counterpoint Research projects will be the top smartphone maker for 2025—the first time since 2011[5][6][7][8]. Samsung's surveys show awareness of its Galaxy AI brand surged to 80% from roughly 30% within just one year, signaling growing consumer adoption[1][2][3].</description>

      <description>Samsung co-CEO TM Roh warned that an "unprecedented" memory chip shortage is hitting the technology industry, with price increases for smartphones and TVs now "inevitable" as manufacturers grapple with surging costs driven by insatiable demand from artificial intelligence data centers[1][2][3].

"As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact," Roh told Reuters in an interview published January 4, adding that the crisis affects not only mobile phones but other consumer electronics, from TVs to home appliances[1][2]. He did not rule out raising product prices, saying some impact was "inevitable" from a surge in memory chip prices[3].</description>

      <title>Tech giants' $400B AI spending spree raises inflation fears</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/ai-spending-boom-sparks-inflat-9oHMaZuaRrWwO3Ah64KZlw</link>
      <description>Global stock markets are riding high on artificial intelligence euphoria at the start of 2026, but investors may be overlooking a significant threat: a surge in inflation driven partly by the technology investment boom, coupled with mounting power constraints that could derail ambitious AI buildout plans[1].

Tech giants including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon are projected to spend more than $400 billion combined in 2026 on AI infrastructure, up from approximately $380 billion in 2025[2][3][4]. Alphabet disclosed in its third-quarter 2025 earnings that capital expenditures for 2025 would reach around $85 billion, with expectations of further increases in 2026[5][6]. Microsoft spent $34.9 billion on capital expenditures in the first quarter of its fiscal 2026, with half allocated to short-lived assets like GPUs and CPUs[5][4].

Yet this spending spree is raising concerns among fund managers about inflation pressures that could force central banks to halt interest rate cuts. "You need a pin to burst the bubble, and it will likely come through tighter monetary conditions," said Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management[7][1]. Morgan Stanley strategist Andrew Sheets projects U.S. consumer price inflation will remain above the Federal Reserve's 2% target until late 2027, partly due to substantial corporate investments in AI[7][1].</description>

      <description>Artificial intelligence safety experts are sounding urgent alarms that rapid technological advances could outpace global efforts to manage emerging risks, with several researchers warning that humanity may be "sleepwalking" into a major transition without adequate safeguards in place.

David Dalrymple, an AI safety expert at the UK government's Advanced Research and Invention Agency, told The Guardian that the world "may not have time" to prepare for safety risks posed by rapidly advancing AI systems[1][2]. "We will be outcompeted in all of the domains that we need to be dominant in, in order to maintain control of our civilisation, society, and planet," he said, projecting that within five years most economically valuable tasks will be performed by machines at higher quality and lower cost than humans[1][2].</description>

      <title>Trump claims US in charge of Venezuela after Maduro arrest</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-claims-us-control-over-v-jlr1s9n6SDScmNQrX.lDcw</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump declared the United States is "in charge" of Venezuela following a military operation that captured longtime leader Nicolás Maduro, outlining plans to rebuild the country's oil infrastructure before eventual elections[1][2][3].

"Don't ask me who's in charge because I'll give you an answer, and it'll be very controversial," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. When pressed to clarify, he replied, "It means we're in charge"[1][3].

The stunning announcement came after U.S. special forces captured Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in the early morning hours of January 3 during Operation Absolute Resolve, which involved more than 150 aircraft and strikes across northern Venezuela[4][5]. Maduro is scheduled to appear in Manhattan federal court on January 5 to face narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy, and weapons charges[6][7].</description>

      <description>Asian stock markets climbed to record highs Monday, led by a powerful rally in technology shares, as investors largely looked past geopolitical turmoil following the weekend US capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Gold prices surged while oil fluctuated in early trading.

South Korea's Kospi jumped 3.43% to close at 4,457.52 points, breaking through 4,400 for the first time[1]. Japan's Nikkei 225 soared 2.97% to near its record high[1], while Taiwan's benchmark rose 2.57% past 30,000 points for the first time[1]. The rallies extended last year's artificial intelligence boom, with MSCI's Asia-Pacific stock index climbing as much as 1.7% to an all-time high[2].

Samsung Electronics led gains with a 7.47% surge[1], while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing rocketed more than 5% after Goldman Sachs raised its price target by 35%[3]. SK Hynix climbed 2.81%[1]. US stock futures rose modestly, with S&amp;P 500 futures up 0.1%[4][5].</description>

      <title>Trump warns Venezuela of second strike if cooperation fails</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-threatens-second-strike-CGHvZ5cdQXSOhDgwdJytww</link>
      <description>Oil prices edged lower Monday as President Donald Trump threatened another military operation against Venezuela while his administration doubled down on an oil embargo aimed at forcing sweeping changes in the South American nation.

Brent crude fell 1.4% to $59.91 per barrel by the close of trading Monday, while West Texas Intermediate declined to $56.56, as markets weighed the fallout from the weekend capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro against concerns about global supply surplus[1][2][3]. Trump told reporters Sunday he could order a second strike if Venezuela's interim government fails to cooperate with US efforts to reshape the country's oil industry and halt drug trafficking[4][5][6].</description>

      <title>Markets rise as US captures Venezuelan President Maduro</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/markets-rise-after-us-captures-129XXryCQa6Yjla1zjv_dg</link>
      <description>Global stock markets climbed Monday as investors absorbed the dramatic weekend US military operation in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro, with traders weighing geopolitical risks against potential long-term economic opportunities[1][2][3].

US stock futures rose in early trading, with the S&amp;P 500 gaining 0.2%, the Nasdaq 100 jumping 0.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average edging up 0.1%[1][2]. European markets also advanced, with London's FTSE 100 rising 0.2%, Germany's DAX climbing 1%, and France's CAC 40 up 0.6%[3].

The subdued market reaction reflected analysts' assessment that Venezuela's limited oil production—currently below 1 million barrels per day, or less than 1% of global supply—constrains the potential for major disruptions[1][3][4]. "Venezuela accounts for less than 1% of global oil, and at best a political outcome restoring production will take years," said Lale Akoner, a global market analyst at eToro[3].

Gold prices surged 2.3% to $4,433.71 per ounce as investors sought safe-haven assets amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty[3][5][6]. Meanwhile, oil futures fluctuated in early trading, with Brent crude falling 0.4% to $60.60 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate declining 0.5% to $56.97[3][7].</description>

      <title>Investors shift to value stocks amid AI inflation fears</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/investors-shift-focus-amid-202-BU7v.4w0TFmaUZD6s9mlKQ</link>
      <description>As global stock markets enter 2026 riding high on artificial intelligence enthusiasm, a growing chorus of investors and strategists warn that surging AI-related spending could reignite inflation and derail the rally, prompting a strategic shift toward undervalued assets.

Money managers are increasingly concerned that the multi-trillion-dollar race among tech giants Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet to build AI data centers is driving up costs for chips and energy, creating inflationary pressures that markets may be underestimating. Deutsche Bank projects AI data center capital expenditure could reach $4 trillion by 2030[1][2][3], while Morgan Stanley strategist Andrew Sheets notes that "costs are going up not down in our forecast, because there's inflation in chip costs and inflation in power costs"[1][2][4].

"What keeps us awake at night is that inflation risk has resurfaced," said Julius Bendikas, European head of economics and dynamic asset allocation at Mercer, which manages $683 billion in assets[1][2]. Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management, warned that while he continues holding tech stocks for now, he "would not be surprised to see inflation booming worldwide by the end of 2026"[5][2].</description>

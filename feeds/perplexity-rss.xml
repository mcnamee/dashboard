      <title>China's giant telescope captures first clear evidence of fast radio burst origins</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/china-telescope-reveals-cause-GCUr10_oS_uexolz3_zOrA</link>
      <description>Using the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, an international team of researchers has captured the first clear evidence linking mysterious cosmic radio signals to a dense plasma cloud, providing strong support for the theory that some fast radio bursts originate from binary star systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings, published Friday in the journal Science, are based on nearly 20 months of observations by China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, known as FAST, of a repeating fast radio burst designated FRB 20220529, located approximately 2.9 billion light-years from Earth.</description>

      <title>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS spins every 7 hours, study finds</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/3iatlas-interstellar-object-ro-xOgCoCYuS.2wVj2cJkHhGQ</link>
      <description>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS completes a full rotation approximately every 7.1 hours, according to new research by Harvard astrophysicist Abraham Loeb and Italian astronomer Toni Scarmato. The findings arrive just days before a rare celestial alignment on January 22 that could provide unprecedented data about this cosmic traveler from beyond our solar system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study, which analyzed Hubble Space Telescope images from late 2025, used two independent methods to determine the rotation period: tracking the wobble of the comet's jet-like features and measuring brightness variations over time. The jet position angle analysis yielded a period of 7.20 ± 0.05 hours, while photometric measurements produced 7.136 ± 0.001 hours.</description>

      <title>Canada and China strike trade deal on EVs, canola amid US tensions</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/canada-and-china-forge-new-str-PUW0WR_iR3GMkdJuV08EWA</link>
      <description>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a landmark trade agreement on Friday in Beijing, with Canada agreeing to slash tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles in exchange for China reducing duties on Canadian agricultural products, marking a dramatic shift in Ottawa's trade policy away from the United States.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under the deal, Canada will allow up to 49,000 Chinese EVs into the country at a 6.1% tariff rate, replacing the 100% duty imposed by former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2024. The quota will increase to 70,000 vehicles over five years. In return, China will lower tariffs on Canadian canola seed from approximately 84% to 15% by March 1, according to statements from both governments.</description>

      <description>Former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was sentenced to five years in prison on Friday by the Seoul Central District Court, marking the first verdict in a series of criminal trials stemming from his brief declaration of martial law in December 2024.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The court found Yoon guilty of obstructing authorities from executing an arrest warrant, falsifying official documents, and failing to follow proper legal procedures for declaring martial law, according to a live broadcast of the verdict. The ruling comes half the 10-year sentence prosecutors had requested, setting the stage for a more consequential insurrection verdict expected next month.</description>

      <title>Trump threatens tariffs on nations opposing his Greenland bid</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-threatens-tariffs-over-g-ulearT0aRQqvMyMY65iJwQ</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump warned Friday that he may impose tariffs on countries that do not support his efforts to acquire Greenland, escalating his campaign to take control of the strategically vital Arctic territory despite growing international opposition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security," Trump said during a roundtable event at the White House. The threat came as European nations deployed military personnel to the semiautonomous Danish territory for joint exercises, and a bipartisan delegation of U.S. lawmakers arrived in Copenhagen to demonstrate solidarity with Denmark.</description>

      <description>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy firmly rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's assertion that Ukraine is obstructing peace negotiations, declaring that his country "has never been and will never be an obstacle to peace" while pointing to ongoing Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure as evidence of Moscow's true intentions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dispute erupted after Trump told Reuters on January 15 that Russian President Vladimir Putin is "ready to make a deal" while characterizing Ukraine as "less ready." When asked why U.S.-led negotiations had failed to end the nearly four-year-old conflict, Trump responded with a single word: "Zelenskyy."</description>

      <description>The interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS continues to defy expectations, maintaining active outgassing and shedding material with a chemical composition unlike anything found in our solar system—even as it recedes toward the outer reaches of space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A ground-based telescope in Hawaii captured the object on January 14, 2026, revealing a compact nucleus surrounded by a structured coma and the early formation of a tail, despite the comet being approximately 300 million kilometers from Earth. At such distances, most small bodies would fade into obscurity, yet 3I/ATLAS remains visible and active.</description>

      <description>OpenAI announced Friday it will begin testing advertisements in ChatGPT, a major shift for the artificial intelligence company as it seeks to diversify revenue beyond subscriptions amid mounting operational costs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ads will roll out to users of the free version of the chatbot as well as those subscribing to ChatGPT Go, the company's newly launched budget-tier subscription that is becoming available globally at around $8 per month, according to The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg. The move comes as OpenAI faces pressure to monetize its massive user base, with only about 5% of ChatGPT's 800 million weekly active users paying for subscriptions.</description>

      <description>Malaysia and Indonesia have become the first countries in the world to block access to Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok after regulators determined the tool was being used to generate sexually explicit and nonconsensual deepfake images, including content depicting women and minors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indonesia's Ministry of Communication and Digital Affairs ordered restrictions on January 10, with Malaysia's Communications and Multimedia Commission following on January 11. The bans came after officials in both countries concluded that safeguards implemented by xAI, the company behind Grok, had failed to stop the spread of obscene content on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.</description>

      <description>The United States has intensified its condemnation of South Africa following the "Will for Peace 2026" naval exercises that concluded on Friday off Cape Town's coast, with the House Committee on Foreign Affairs accusing Pretoria of undermining American national security. The criticism comes one day after the US Embassy in South Africa publicly lambasted the country for allowing Iran to participate in the drills alongside Chinese and Russian vessels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The week-long exercises, which ran from January 9 to 16, brought together naval forces from Iran, China, Russia, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates, along with observers from Brazil, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Egypt. The drills are described by South African officials as part of the BRICS Plus framework aimed at enhancing maritime security.</description>

      <description>The Trump administration held months of quiet discussions with Venezuela's interior minister Diosdado Cabello before the January 3 military operation that captured President Nicolás Maduro, and communications have continued since, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter in an exclusive Reuters report published Friday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;U.S. officials warned Cabello, 62, against deploying security services or militant ruling-party supporters to target Venezuela's opposition, four sources told Reuters. The talks also addressed U.S. sanctions imposed on him and his federal drug-trafficking indictment. Despite being named in the same indictment that justified Maduro's arrest—with a $25 million bounty on his head—Cabello was not apprehended during the operation.</description>

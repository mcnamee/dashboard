      <title>Japan's largest nuclear plant halts restart hours after launch</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/japan-restarts-world-s-largest-GmPvNaYTSf.JmgYIlF6DTQ</link>
      <description>Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings launched its first reactor since the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster on Wednesday evening, only to suspend operations hours later after an alarm sounded during startup procedures—underscoring the persistent technical challenges facing Japan's nuclear revival.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The No. 6 reactor at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant in Niigata Prefecture was reactivated at 7:02 p.m. local time on Wednesday and reached criticality around 90 minutes later. But at 12:28 a.m. Thursday, an alarm from a control rod monitoring system triggered a halt to operations, forcing TEPCO to suspend the withdrawal of control rods essential for regulating nuclear fission.</description>

      <title>Google's AI can now search your emails and photos for answers</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/google-adds-personal-intellige-UYF3bulPTMWjQ3tLiP8EtA</link>
      <description>Google is expanding its "Personal Intelligence" AI feature to its flagship search engine's AI Mode, allowing the company's Gemini chatbot to analyze users' emails, photos, and YouTube history to deliver customized search results. The expansion, announced Wednesday, follows the initial January 14 rollout of Personal Intelligence in the standalone Gemini app.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The feature marks a significant shift in how Google handles user data for AI-powered services. When enabled, Gemini can reason across a user's Gmail, Google Photos, and YouTube viewing history to provide tailored answers to search queries—from finding license plate numbers stored in photos to suggesting vacation destinations based on past travel patterns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Personal Intelligence securely connects information from apps like Gmail and Google Photos to make Gemini uniquely helpful," Josh Woodward, Google's vice president overseeing the Gemini app, wrote in a blog post. "You control exactly which apps to link, and each one supercharges the experience."</description>

      <title>Moderna halts new vaccine trial investments, citing US opposition</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/moderna-halts-vaccine-trial-in-tPfzSvhrRMWQwFrs6JJ7cQ</link>
      <description>Moderna will not invest in new late-stage vaccine trials due to growing opposition to immunizations from US officials, Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel announced at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"You cannot make a return on investment if you don't have access to the US market," Bancel told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday, explaining that regulatory delays and lack of support from US health officials are making the potential market size "much smaller."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The announcement reflects the deepening chill across the vaccine industry as anti-vaccine rhetoric under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has translated into concrete policy changes over the past year.</description>

      <description>Elon Musk made his debut at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, predicting that robots would eventually outnumber humans and that artificial intelligence would surpass collective human intelligence within five years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Tesla and SpaceX chief appeared as a surprise late addition to the forum's schedule, joining BlackRock CEO Larry Fink for a wide-ranging conversation that marked a reversal for the tech billionaire who has previously dismissed the annual gathering as "elitist" and "boring."</description>

      <title>Scientists find black hole growing 13 times faster than theory allows</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/scientists-find-fastest-growin-eRAlCG4oTUiR7qh8zetLew</link>
      <description>An international research team has discovered a supermassive black hole in the early universe growing at 13 times the theoretical speed limit, challenging current models of how these cosmic giants form and evolve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The discovery, announced Wednesday by scientists at Waseda University and Tohoku University in Japan, used observations from the Subaru Telescope to measure gas motion around a black hole that existed when the universe was less than 1.5 billion years old. The findings, published in The Astrophysical Journal, reveal an object accreting matter at rates that defy conventional astrophysics.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner presented Thursday a sweeping vision to transform war-ravaged Gaza into a luxury coastal destination, unveiling a $25 billion reconstruction plan at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, alongside the formal launch of Trump's "Board of Peace" initiative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The announcement included a pledge from Ali Shaath, head of the newly formed National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, that the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt would reopen next week for the first time since Israeli forces took control of it in 2024.</description>

      <title>NATO to bolster Arctic security after Trump-Rutte discussions</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/nations-intensify-race-for-arc-I67axVxdS2mfDV3SUQv9JQ</link>
      <description>Global powers are escalating their competition for dominance in the Arctic as melting ice opens new shipping routes and exposes vast mineral reserves, transforming the region into what military and political leaders describe as a strategic frontier of the 21st century.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The race intensified this week when NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte announced that alliance members would move to enhance Arctic security following discussions with U.S. President Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Rutte told Reuters that NATO would "convene alongside senior commanders to determine what actions are necessary," expressing confidence the alliance could accomplish this "quite swiftly" by 2026.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finnish President Alexander Stubb said he aims to have an Arctic security strategy ready before the NATO summit scheduled for July in Turkey.</description>

      <description>Spot gold crossed the $4,900-per-ounce threshold for the first time on Thursday, while platinum surged to an all-time high, as investors piled into precious metals amid escalating geopolitical tensions and turmoil in global bond markets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The historic rally extends gold's extraordinary run into 2026, with the metal gaining 11% since the start of the year and approximately 75% over the past 12 months. Platinum, meanwhile, rose 3% to reach a record $2,558.20 per ounce, having climbed nearly 160% over the past year.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump declared Thursday that the United States would have "total access" to Greenland under a framework agreement reached with NATO, even as the European Union suspended approval of a bilateral trade deal in response to weeks of tariff threats tied to the Arctic territory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump's announcement, made from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, marked an apparent de-escalation after he withdrew his threat to impose 10% tariffs on eight European nations beginning February 1. But the deal's specifics remain unclear, and Denmark has firmly stated its sovereignty is not up for negotiation.</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/earthquake-monitors-track-spac-0X9HrvrLRv2.tmakxEFY8w</link>
      <description>Scientists have demonstrated that earthquake monitors can track falling space debris through sonic booms, offering a new method to pinpoint where dangerous fragments land as the skies become increasingly crowded with satellites.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers reported Thursday that seismic readings from sonic booms generated when a discarded Chinese crew capsule module reentered over Southern California in 2024 allowed them to place the object's path nearly 20 miles farther south than radar had predicted from orbit, according to findings published in the journal Science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The problem at the moment is we can track stuff very well in space," said Benjamin Fernando of Johns Hopkins University, the lead researcher. "But once it gets to the point that it's actually breaking up in the atmosphere, it becomes very difficult to track."</description>

      <description>The 2026 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, became a stage for clashing economic worldviews this week as President Donald Trump defended his aggressive tariff policies while Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng championed multilateralism and free trade—a split that is accelerating the reshaping of global economic alliances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump addressed the forum on Wednesday, touting what he called an "economic miracle" achieved through tariffs that he said slashed the U.S. monthly trade deficit by 77 percent in one year. "Virtually all of the so-called experts predicted my plans to end this failed model would trigger a global recession and runaway inflation. But we have proven them wrong," he declared. He criticized European economic policies, stating that "certain places in Europe are not even recognizable, frankly, anymore."</description>

      <description>Shell is considering selling some or all of its assets in Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale formation, a move that would mark a surprise exit by one of the region's earliest backers just as international interest in the massive play intensifies, according to a Reuters report citing three sources familiar with the matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The oil major has approached potential buyers in recent weeks to gauge interest in the holdings, which are likely to be valued in the billions of dollars, two of the sources said. However, a sale is not guaranteed, and Shell could still choose to retain the assets. The company declined to comment.</description>

      <description>The James Webb Space Telescope has delivered a striking one-two punch of cosmic discoveries this week, capturing the clearest infrared images ever taken of the Helix Nebula while also solving a decades-old puzzle about how crystals found in comets formed in the frozen reaches of space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NASA unveiled the new Helix Nebula images on Tuesday, offering an unprecedented look at one of the most photographed planetary nebulas in the sky. Located 650 light-years from Earth in the constellation Aquarius and often called the "Eye of God," the nebula has never appeared with such detail.</description>

      <description>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reaches a rare and fleeting celestial alignment today, positioning itself directly opposite the sun from Earth's perspective and offering scientists a once-in-decades opportunity to study material from another star system before the enigmatic visitor departs forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 13:00 UTC on January 22, 2026, 3I/ATLAS will align to within just 0.69 degrees of the Earth-Sun axis—an exceptionally small angle that creates ideal conditions for what astronomers call an "opposition surge," a phenomenon that will cause the object to appear brighter and reveal more about its composition. Unlike typical cometary oppositions that last only hours, this alignment will keep 3I/ATLAS within two degrees of the axis for approximately one week.</description>

      <description>Russian President Vladimir Putin began late-night talks with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner at the Kremlin on Thursday, January 22, 2026, as diplomatic efforts to end the nearly four-year Ukraine war enter what negotiators describe as a final stretch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The meeting, which started shortly before midnight Moscow time, brought together three American representatives—Witkoff, Kushner, and newly appointed senior adviser Josh Gruenbaum—with Putin's team, including foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov and special envoy Kirill Dmitriev, according to the Kremlin's official account. A brief video released by Russian state media showed Putin shaking hands with the American delegation and inviting them to a long oval table.</description>

      <description>European lawmakers have frozen work on an EU-U.S. trade agreement after President Donald Trump tied threatened tariffs on key U.S. allies to his push for greater U.S. control and access in Greenland, reopening a geopolitical dispute that had already rattled markets this week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The standoff escalated after Trump said he would impose new duties on eight European countries beginning Feb. 1 unless an arrangement was reached over Greenland—then reversed course in Davos, saying he would not use force and that a “framework” with NATO was in view, prompting a relief bounce in equities.</description>

      <description>Investments that help communities withstand drought and conflict—especially by boosting farm productivity and basic services—may also curb displacement pressures across Africa, according to a new peer‑reviewed study published in the journal Sustainable Development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research, led by Hyun Kim of Chungnam National University, analyzes African country- and grid-level data spanning 1995–2015 and finds that **stronger “adaptive capacity”** is associated with **lower migration during periods of drought or armed conflict**, acting as a buffer when shocks hit.</description>

      <description>Researchers at the University of Wisconsin–Madison have resurrected a 3.2-billion-year-old enzyme and studied it inside living microbes, creating a new way to understand the origins of life on Earth and potentially recognize signs of life on other planets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The NASA-funded study, published in Nature Communications on January 22, uses synthetic biology to reverse-engineer modern enzymes and rebuild their ancient ancestors. The research team, led by Betül Kaçar, a professor of bacteriology, and Holly Rucker, a PhD candidate in Kaçar's lab, focused on nitrogenase, an enzyme essential for converting atmospheric nitrogen into a form usable by living organisms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We picked an enzyme that really set the tone of life on this planet and then interrogated its history," Kaçar says. "Without nitrogenase, there would be no life as we know it."</description>

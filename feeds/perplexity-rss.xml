      <title>Denmark says White House talks failed to shift Trump's Greenland stance</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/greenland-s-harsh-terrain-bloc-hMeP1MDfQT6CC0VTQa.l3A</link>
      <description>Despite President Donald Trump's intensifying push to gain control of Greenland, experts warn that the Arctic territory's severe climate, remote geography, and absent infrastructure pose obstacles that no change in sovereignty could overcome. The island's vast mineral wealth remains locked beneath ice and rock that have defied extraction efforts for decades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"If you're going to go to Greenland for its minerals, you're talking billions upon billions upon billions of dollars and extremely long time before anything ever comes of it," mineral industry analyst Louis Marchese told Fortune, offering a sobering assessment of the mining reality.</description>

      <title>Study finds ocean damage nearly doubles climate cost estimates</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/ocean-damage-doubles-climate-c-JbqmWa9lRcu9w4EAJ5OqMA</link>
      <description>The economic toll of climate change on the world's oceans has been vastly underestimated, according to new research that for the first time puts a price tag on marine ecosystem degradation—findings that emerge alongside a separate study warning that proposed climate engineering solutions carry their own risks to ocean life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Research published Wednesday in the journal Nature Climate Change by scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego found that factoring ocean damage into climate calculations nearly doubles the global cost of carbon dioxide emissions. The study introduces what researchers call the "blue" social cost of carbon, adding $46.2 per ton of CO2 to existing estimates, bringing the total to $97.2 per ton—a 91% increase.</description>

      <description>As Brazil's Atlantic Forest shrinks and wildlife vanishes, mosquitoes are increasingly targeting humans for their blood meals, raising fresh concerns about the spread of diseases such as dengue, Zika, and yellow fever, according to a study published this week in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research, conducted by scientists at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, analyzed blood samples from mosquitoes captured in nature reserves within the Atlantic Forest. The results showed a pronounced shift: of the identifiable blood meals, 18 came from humans—far outpacing other sources, which included only six birds, one amphibian, one rodent, and one canid.</description>

      <title>Trump advisers warned Iran strike unlikely to topple regime</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-advisers-warned-iran-str-18ji.kBdRNSg6xa_ZweWfg</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump's national security advisers have cautioned him that a substantial military strike against Iran would probably not lead to the collapse of the Islamic Republic's government and could instead trigger a wider regional conflict, according to U.S. officials familiar with the discussions. The assessment came as Trump signaled a potential pause in his escalating threats against Tehran, saying Wednesday he had been informed that killings of protesters had stopped.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The president has communicated to his advisers that he wants any military action to be "swift and decisive" and deliver a "definitive" blow to the regime, according to NBC News. However, officials said his team has been unable to guarantee that outcome, with concerns mounting that the United States may lack sufficient military assets in the region to defend against what is expected to be an aggressive Iranian response.</description>

      <description>Acting Venezuelan President Delcy Rodríguez has submitted a proposal to reform her country's hydrocarbon law, seeking to open doors to greater US investment in the oil-rich nation less than two weeks after US special forces captured former President Nicolás Maduro in a surprise military operation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rodríguez announced on Thursday that she was proposing the reforms to Venezuela's National Assembly, a move that addresses a key demand from major American oil companies who have described the country as "uninvestable" under current regulations. At her first press conference since Maduro's ouster, Rodríguez also declared Venezuela was entering a "new political era" marked by greater tolerance toward political rivals.</description>

      <description>Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered the transfer of former President Jair Bolsonaro to the Papuda Penitentiary Complex in Brasilia on Thursday, according to court documents released January 15, 2026. The move represents a stark shift in the conditions under which the 70-year-old far-right politician will serve his 27-year sentence for plotting a coup following his 2022 election defeat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bolsonaro has been detained at the Federal Police Superintendency since his arrest in late November 2025, housed in a 12-square-meter room equipped with a bed, private bathroom, air conditioning, television, and desk. Under the new order, he will be relocated to a building within the Papuda complex, Brazil's largest maximum-security penitentiary facility in the capital.</description>

      <description>The third known interstellar object to visit our solar system continues to puzzle astronomers as it exits toward Jupiter, displaying sunward jets that defy conventional comet physics while yielding no detectable alien signals to radio telescopes scanning for signs of extraterrestrial technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Comet 3I/ATLAS, first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey in Chile, has been the subject of intense scientific scrutiny since its discovery. With the Breakthrough Listen project confirming no technosignatures were detected during five hours of observation using the Green Bank Telescope on December 18, 2025, researchers have largely settled the question of whether this cosmic wanderer might be artificial.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We all would have been thrilled to find technosignatures coming from 3I/ATLAS, but they're just not there," Benjamin Jacobson-Bell from the University of California, Berkeley, told Space.com. "Finding no signals was the result we expected, due to the significant evidence for 3I/ATLAS being a comet with only natural features."</description>

      <description>A team of international scientists has produced the most comprehensive map yet of Antarctica's concealed terrain, revealing thousands of previously unknown hills, ridges, and river channels buried beneath miles of ice. The breakthrough, published Thursday in the journal Science, could transform researchers' ability to predict how the frozen continent will respond to climate change and contribute to rising sea levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The map uncovers geological features spanning 2 to 30 kilometers beneath the ice sheet, which covers more than 5.4 million square miles. Among the discoveries are deep alpine valleys, extensive channels carved by ancient flowing water that stretch for hundreds of kilometers, and sharp transitions between highland and lowland terrain that may indicate tectonic boundaries.</description>

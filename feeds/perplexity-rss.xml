      <title>Lunai Bioworks launches AI tool to block chemical weapon design</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/lunai-bioworks-launches-sentin-AKQL3AHbQ86nRzLFhVT0kQ</link>
      <description>Lunai Bioworks on Tuesday announced the deployment of Sentinel, a transformer-based AI safeguard designed to prevent large language models and scientific AI systems from generating novel chemical agents. The Sacramento-based biotech company said the technology embeds directly within foundation models to screen molecular outputs in real time, functioning as what CEO David Weinstein described as "the immune system for scientific AI."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"As AI models become more powerful, safety has to move closer to the core," Weinstein said in a statement. "Sentinel operates inside AI systems—not outside them—stopping dangerous chemical designs before they are ever produced."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The launch comes amid mounting concern over the dual-use risks of advanced AI in chemistry and biology, with major AI companies including Anthropic and OpenAI warning that powerful models could assist bad actors in developing biological and chemical threats.</description>

      <title>Study finds narrow ocean bands absorb 72% of seas' carbon</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/ocean-fronts-absorb-72-percent-42IyYWCIRMG2gh_C4xsxkg</link>
      <description>Narrow bands of ocean covering just over one-third of the world's seas are responsible for absorbing nearly three-quarters of the carbon dioxide that oceans pull from the atmosphere, according to new research that reshapes scientific understanding of Earth's carbon cycle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study, published in Nature Climate Change, reveals that ocean fronts—turbulent boundaries where different water masses collide—cover 36 percent of the global ocean but account for 72 percent of total oceanic carbon dioxide uptake, absorbing approximately 1.8 billion tons of carbon annually.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"This is the first time we've been able to quantify the disproportionate role that ocean fronts play in absorbing atmospheric CO2 on a global scale, and it has major implications for climate modelling," said lead author Dr. Kai Yang, who completed the research during his PhD at the University of Tasmania's Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) and is now a postdoctoral researcher at Xiamen University in China.</description>

      <title>Tesla brand value drops 36% as Musk's politics erode trust</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/tesla-faces-third-year-of-decl-1msXq1sYRrmItVOaSmonVQ</link>
      <description>Tesla faces a crossroads this week as its brand value hits a three-year low and Wall Street braces for another year of declining profitability. The electric vehicle maker is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2025 earnings on Wednesday, January 28, amid mounting evidence that CEO Elon Musk's political activities and the company's aging vehicle lineup are weighing heavily on business performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Brand Finance, Tesla's brand value fell by $15.4 billion, or 36%, in 2025, marking its third consecutive annual decline. The London-based research firm now values the Tesla brand at $27.61 billion, down from $43 billion at the start of 2025 and well below its peak of $66.2 billion in January 2023.</description>

      <title>NASA's Juno measures Europa's ice shell at 18 miles thick</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/nasa-and-scientists-reveal-new-HxZN.EY1SMi69pzpf8BglA</link>
      <description>Jupiter's moon Europa remains one of the most tantalizing targets in the search for extraterrestrial life, but two recent studies paint a complex and sometimes contradictory picture of whether its vast subsurface ocean could actually support living organisms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NASA announced on Sunday that data from the Juno spacecraft has provided the first direct measurement of Europa's ice shell thickness, determining it averages about 18 miles (29 kilometers) in the region observed during a 2022 flyby. The findings, published in Nature Astronomy in December, represent a landmark measurement that settles a long-standing scientific debate over whether the shell is thin or thick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The 18-mile estimate relates to the cold, rigid, conductive outer-layer of a pure water ice shell," said Steve Levin, Juno project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "If an inner, slightly warmer convective layer also exists, which is possible, the total ice shell thickness would be even greater."</description>

      <description>Colombian President Gustavo Petro said Tuesday that ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro should be returned to face trial in his home country rather than in the United States, adding a new layer of complexity to regional tensions one week before his scheduled meeting with President Donald Trump.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"They have to return him and have him tried by a Venezuelan court, not a US one," Petro said Tuesday, according to Bloomberg. The statement marks the Colombian leader's most direct intervention yet in the diplomatic standoff over Maduro's fate since US forces captured the former Venezuelan president in a dramatic pre-dawn raid on January 3.</description>

      <description>Nearly four years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the combined military toll of the conflict is approaching two million casualties, according to a study released Tuesday by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Washington-based think tank estimates approximately 1.2 million Russian troops and close to 600,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed, wounded, or gone missing since February 2022, bringing the current total to roughly 1.8 million. By this spring, the study projects, that figure will reach two million if current trends continue.</description>

      <description>Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Tuesday that the Trump administration is prepared to use military force to ensure Venezuela's acting President Delcy Rodríguez complies with American demands, escalating tensions nearly a month after US special forces captured Nicolás Maduro in a dramatic predawn raid on Caracas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The warning came as Colombia's President Gustavo Petro called for Maduro to be returned to Venezuela to face trial in his home country rather than in the United States. "They have to return him and have him tried by a Venezuelan court, not a US one," Petro said Tuesday, one week before a scheduled February 3 meeting with Trump at the White House.</description>

      <description>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared that the upcoming Workers' Party congress will reveal "next-stage plans" for strengthening the country's nuclear war deterrent, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported on Wednesday. The announcement came after Kim supervised a ballistic missile test on Tuesday that drew international condemnation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kim made the remarks while overseeing a test of a large-caliber multiple-rocket launch system that KCNA said demonstrated "significant upgrades" in strike power, mobility, and accuracy. The rockets reportedly struck targets 358 kilometers away in the East Sea. Kim emphasized that developing a "reliable offensive capability and deterrence strategy" is a key policy of the ruling Workers' Party to counter any attempts at armed conflict.</description>

      <description>Artificial intelligence could be autonomously generating scientific hypotheses and conducting research experiments within the next five years, according to leading researchers, even as philosophers and scientists debate whether machines can ever truly replace human researchers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EPFL associate professor Robert West and Northwestern University professor Ágnes Horvát said in an interview published this week that the role of AI in science is poised for a fundamental shift—from assisting with writing and data analysis to actually proposing the questions that drive research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I think the next step, and perhaps five years is a reasonable time frame for that, is for AI to come up with the ideas we study," Horvát said. "That's very different territory because then the AI is providing the hypothesis that needs to be researched."</description>

      <description>China has granted approval for its first shipment of Nvidia H200 artificial intelligence chips, marking a pivotal shift in Beijing's approach to balancing its AI ambitions with efforts to promote domestic semiconductor development. The authorization covers several hundred thousand units and was issued during Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's ongoing visit to the country, according to Reuters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The approval, which extends to three major Chinese internet companies, signals a thaw in tensions that saw Chinese customs briefly block H200 shipments earlier this month despite U.S. export clearance. Sources indicate that Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance are among the firms granted initial clearance, with additional companies awaiting future approvals.</description>

      <description>The U.S. dollar tumbled to its lowest level since early 2022 on Tuesday after President Donald Trump appeared unconcerned about its recent slide, describing the currency as "doing great" when asked if it had fallen too much. The remarks accelerated a sell-off that lifted gold to record highs above $5,200 an ounce on Wednesday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, dropped to 95.566 on Tuesday — its weakest reading in nearly four years — before stabilizing around 96 in Asian trading on Wednesday. Trump's comments in Iowa intensified what had already been the currency's largest three-day drop since last April's tariff turmoil.</description>

      <description>New research from Japan suggests artificial intelligence systems may benefit from a surprisingly human trait: talking to themselves. Scientists at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) have demonstrated that AI models learn more efficiently, adapt to new situations more easily, and handle multiple tasks better when trained to use internal "mumbling" alongside short-term memory systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings, published in Neural Computation on January 28, reveal that combining self-directed inner speech with working memory architecture allows AI to generalize across different tasks more effectively while requiring far less training data than conventional approaches.</description>

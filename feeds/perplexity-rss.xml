      <description>Elon Musk's SpaceX and xAI are in negotiations regarding a potential merger ahead of what could become the largest initial public offering in history, according to exclusive reporting by Reuters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The merger would unite Musk's aerospace empire with his artificial intelligence venture, consolidating the Starlink satellite network, the X social media platform, and the Grok AI chatbot under a single corporate structure. Reuters reported that two Nevada entities were established on January 21 to facilitate the transaction, with SpaceX Chief Financial Officer Bret Johnsen listed as a managing member in corporate filings.</description>

      <title>Cuba's oil reserves down to 15-20 days as U.S. pressure mounts</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/cuba-faces-critical-oil-shorta-RmS89jOkQDWR7wQjCfBiUg</link>
      <description>Cuba's oil reserves have dwindled to a level that will sustain the island for only 15 to 20 days, according to data from energy analytics firm Kpler, as U.S. pressure on traditional suppliers threatens to push the nation toward economic collapse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The crisis has deepened rapidly following the Trump administration's January 3 military operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, effectively severing Cuba's primary oil lifeline. Venezuela, which supplied roughly a third of Cuba's oil at approximately 26,500 barrels per day in 2025, has not shipped any crude or fuel to the Caribbean island since early January.</description>

      <title>Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon in talks to invest $60B in OpenAI</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/tech-giants-in-talks-to-invest-5daBeu84Q9mqlyhbqHDyww</link>
      <description>Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon are in discussions to invest up to $60 billion in OpenAI, according to a report by The Information published Wednesday. The talks, if they lead to a deal, would be one of the largest private financings ever for an AI company and would further entangle the world’s biggest technology suppliers in the scramble for computing power and market share in generative AI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The negotiations are ongoing and terms could change, and Reuters said it could not immediately verify The Information’s reporting. Still, the report fits a widening fundraising push around OpenAI that has drawn in major strategic backers and deep pools of global capital.</description>

      <title>Venezuela approves law ending 20 years of state oil control</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/venezuela-approves-historic-oi-LPgBSK6XSHufeNdUmJwfkg</link>
      <description>Venezuela's National Assembly on Thursday approved a sweeping reform to the country's hydrocarbons law, ending more than two decades of state control over the nation's oil sector and opening the door to private investment in the world's largest proven crude reserves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The vote marks a dramatic departure from the socialist economic model that has governed Venezuela since former President Hugo Chávez nationalized the industry in the mid-2000s. The legislation comes less than a month after the U.S. military captured then-President Nicolás Maduro in Caracas on January 3.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump confirmed on Thursday that he is planning to hold direct talks with Iran as tensions between Washington and Tehran escalate, pairing diplomatic signals with warnings about the naval forces now positioned near the Islamic Republic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I have had and I am planning on it," Trump told reporters at the Kennedy Center when asked about potential discussions with Iran. He simultaneously emphasized the military pressure, stating, "We have a lot of very big, very powerful ships sailing to Iran right now, and it would be great if we didn't have to use them".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking to CBS News on Thursday, Trump revealed he has communicated two key demands to Iran in recent conversations: "No. 1, no nuclear. And No. 2, stop killing protesters".</description>

      <description>NASA researchers have unveiled supercomputer simulations that provide an unprecedented view into the chaotic magnetic interactions between neutron stars in the final moments before they collide, identifying potential electromagnetic signals that future observatories could detect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new findings, announced by NASA on January 29, offer scientists their most detailed look yet at how the magnetospheres—highly magnetized, plasma-filled regions surrounding neutron stars—behave as the city-sized stellar remnants spiral toward a cataclysmic merger. The research, led by Dimitrios Skiathas, a graduate student at the University of Patras in Greece conducting work at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, was published in The Astrophysical Journal.</description>

      <description>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has been traversing our solar system since its discovery in July 2025, continues to reveal unusual features that have prompted scientists to propose a global early warning network for detecting future visitors from beyond our cosmic neighborhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new scientific proposal led by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb and co-authored with graduate researcher Oem Trivedi outlines what they describe as the Comprehensive Interstellar Objects Network, or CISON. The framework argues that humanity is currently underprepared to detect and respond to fast-moving objects arriving from interstellar space.</description>

      <description>Europe's three aerospace giants—Airbus, Leonardo, and Thales—are moving toward creating a unified European space company as the continent races to compete with American rivals and close what industry leaders describe as a widening capability gap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The companies signed a Memorandum of Understanding in October 2025 to merge their space operations into a single entity that would employ approximately 25,000 people and generate about €6.5 billion in annual revenue. The venture, expected to become operational in 2027 pending regulatory approvals, would see Airbus hold a 35% stake while Leonardo and Thales each take 32.5%.</description>

      <description>Scientists have discovered ammonia-bearing compounds on the surface of Jupiter's moon Europa for the first time, NASA announced Thursday, a finding that has prompted renewed optimism about the icy world's potential to harbor life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The discovery emerged from re-analysis of decades-old data collected by NASA's Galileo spacecraft, which studied the Jupiter system between 1995 and 2003. Researcher Al Emran of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California detected faint signals of ammonia near fractures on Europa's frozen surface by examining data from the mission's Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer instrument captured during Galileo's 11th orbit of Jupiter in 1997.</description>

      <description>An international team of astronomers has produced the clearest picture yet of the Milky Way's magnetic field, revealing a landscape of hidden complexity that challenges previous assumptions about our galaxy's invisible architecture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new map, created using data from the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory near Penticton, British Columbia, shows that more than half of the northern sky contains intricate magnetic structures rather than the simple, uniform fields scientists once expected. The research, led by the University of British Columbia Okanagan, was published this week in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series.</description>

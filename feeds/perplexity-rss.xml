      <title>Trump threatens 100% tariffs if Canada proceeds with China deal</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-threatens-100-percent-ta-4a6TXc8.SpSTh8HBBrGEuA</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to impose a 100 percent tariff on all Canadian goods entering the United States if Canada proceeds with its newly signed trade agreement with China, dramatically escalating a week of diplomatic tensions with America's northern neighbor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken," Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to Prime Minister Mark Carney. "China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life."</description>

      <title>Gold crosses $5,000 per ounce for the first time</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/gold-price-surges-past-5000-as-n8ntkW1JTwSvcutEALA6ew</link>
      <description>Gold prices have breached the closely watched $5,000-per-ounce barrier for the first time, capping a historic rally fueled by a weakening U.S. dollar, robust central bank buying, and expectations of further Federal Reserve rate cuts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As of Saturday, January 24, 2026, spot gold traded at approximately $4,988 per ounce after establishing an intra-day record high above $5,009 earlier in the session. The precious metal has gained roughly 15% since the start of 2026 and nearly 80% compared to a year ago. Silver has been equally buoyant, with prices approaching $100 per ounce after hitting unprecedented highs in recent sessions.</description>

      <title>China places two top generals under investigation in major purge</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/chinese-military-leaders-zhang-6A0kczJbSzChVt.srIGHbw</link>
      <description>China's highest-level military purge in decades became official on January 24, 2026, when state media confirmed that Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission and a member of the ruling Politburo, has been placed under investigation for "serious violations of discipline and law." Liu Zhenli, chief of the Joint Staff Department and a CMC member, is also being investigated, according to an announcement from the Ministry of National Defense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The terse statement said the decision to open investigations into both senior military figures followed "deliberation by the Party's central leadership," providing no further details on the alleged violations.</description>

      <title>Trump advisers meet Netanyahu to advance Gaza ceasefire talks</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/netanyahu-rejects-white-house-MhJEyUDnQyyFTPprIwcieQ</link>
      <description>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined a direct White House request for President Isaac Herzog to represent Israel at the inauguration of President Trump's Gaza Board of Peace in Davos, Switzerland, resulting in Israel's notable absence from Thursday's ceremony and exposing tensions between Jerusalem and Washington as Trump's peace initiative advances into its second phase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The White House extended invitations to 58 nations to join the Board of Peace, with Netanyahu himself receiving an invitation, according to Axios. However, due to an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court in 2024, Netanyahu could not travel to Switzerland. With Herzog already attending the World Economic Forum, senior U.S. officials twice approached the Prime Minister's Office on Tuesday and Wednesday, proposing that Herzog sit on stage alongside Arab and Muslim leaders and sign the board's charter, according to Israel's Channel 12.</description>

      <description>An anti-Hamas militia operating under Israeli control has claimed responsibility for the assassination of a senior Hamas police chief in Gaza, as US special envoys arrived in Israel on Saturday to discuss the future of the war-torn territory with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The targeted killing on January 12 by the Popular Forces militia reflects Israel's growing reliance on Palestinian armed groups to combat Hamas in areas it controls, even as the Trump administration pushes forward with its ambitious "Board of Peace" plan to rebuild Gaza.</description>

      <description>World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Saturday rejected the reasons cited by the United States for its formal withdrawal from the U.N. health agency, calling them "untrue" and warning that the exit "makes both the U.S. and the world less safe."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sharp rebuke came two days after Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the completion of the withdrawal process in a joint statement, marking the first time since the WHO's founding in 1948 that the United States has not been a member.</description>

      <description>China's highest-ranking general is accused of disclosing sensitive nuclear arsenal information to the United States, according to The Wall Street Journal, in what analysts are calling the most significant military purge in modern Chinese history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;General Zhang Youxia, 75, the senior vice chairman of the Central Military Commission and long considered one of Xi Jinping's closest military allies, was placed under investigation on Saturday for "serious violations of discipline and law," China's Defense Ministry announced. Liu Zhenli, the CMC's chief of staff who oversees combat planning, was also placed under investigation.</description>

      <description>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney declared Sunday that Canada has "no intention" of pursuing a free trade agreement with China, pushing back against President Donald Trump's threat to impose 100 percent tariffs on all Canadian goods if Ottawa strikes a broader trade pact with Beijing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We have no intention of doing that with China or any other nonmarket economy," Carney told reporters in Ottawa, emphasizing that the recent agreement with Beijing merely addressed specific tariff disputes that emerged over the past two years.</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/platinum-silver-and-palladium-HH4TDUvYSHSYZ165HPNBXQ</link>
      <description>Platinum, silver, and palladium surged to fresh all-time highs on Sunday as a historic rally in precious metals continued unabated, driven by safe-haven demand amid geopolitical turmoil and expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Reuters via MarketScreener, spot platinum climbed more than 3% to reach $2,859.25 per ounce, while spot silver extended its gains to rise nearly 5% to $107.99 per ounce—its highest level ever. Palladium also rallied, rising 3% to $2,076.93 per ounce.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The moves come as gold breached the $5,000 per ounce mark for the first time on Saturday, according to the BBC, capping a week in which precious metals posted extraordinary gains. Silver has now gained more than 40% since the start of 2026 after rallying 147% in 2025, Reuters reported.</description>

      <description>Chinese marine scientists have identified approximately 1,730 distinct viruses lurking in the oxygen-depleted depths of the world's deepest known underwater blue hole, revealing a hidden ecosystem teeming with microbial life forms largely unknown to science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The discovery, conducted by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, centers on the Yongle Blue Hole, colloquially known as the "Dragon Hole," a massive marine sinkhole in the South China Sea that plunges nearly 1,000 feet into the ocean floor. The findings, detailed in research published in the journal Environmental Microbiome, indicate that approximately 77 percent of the viruses detected had never been recorded before and could not be matched to existing databases.</description>

      <description>European Union countries on Monday gave final approval to a law banning Russian gas imports by late 2027, marking a decisive step in the bloc's effort to end its energy dependence on Moscow nearly four years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under the approved legislation, the EU will halt Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports by the end of 2026 and pipeline gas by September 30, 2027. The deadline may extend to November 1, 2027, if a member state struggles to fill its gas storage with non-Russian supplies ahead of winter.</description>

      <description>Gold smashed through the $5,000 barrier for the first time on Monday, climbing to a record above $5,100 as investors piled into safe-haven assets amid a weaker dollar and mounting speculation that the United States and Japan may jointly intervene to prop up the yen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spot gold touched an all-time high of $5,110.50 per ounce, extending a historic rally that has seen the precious metal gain more than 17% in the first weeks of 2026, following a 64% surge last year — its biggest annual gain since 1979. Silver continued its parallel ascent, scaling new peaks above $109 an ounce after breaking $100 for the first time on Friday.</description>

      <description>Venezuela's interim leader Delcy Rodríguez delivered a pointed rebuke to Washington on Sunday, declaring that she has had "enough" of orders from the United States as her government navigates the precarious aftermath of former President Nicolás Maduro's capture by American forces earlier this month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Enough orders from Washington on politicians in Venezuela. Let Venezuelan politics resolve our differences and internal conflicts. Enough of foreign powers," Rodríguez said in an address to oil workers at the Puerto La Cruz refinery in the eastern state of Anzoátegui, according to Xinhua and CNN. The speech, broadcast on state-run television, marked a notable shift in tone from the acting president who initially received backing from the Trump administration.</description>

      <description>The Israeli Defense Forces announced Monday that the body of Master Sgt. Ran Gvili, the last remaining Israeli hostage from the October 7, 2023 attacks, has been found and identified in a Gaza cemetery, bringing a 28-month ordeal to a close and clearing the path for a contentious reopening of the Rafah border crossing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The recovery marks the end of a chapter that began when 251 people were taken captive during Hamas's attack on southern Israel. With Gvili's return, no Israeli hostages remain in the Gaza Strip for the first time in over two years.</description>

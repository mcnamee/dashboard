      <title>Gold nears $5,000 record as Trump announces naval fleet heading to Iran</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/gold-nears-5000-dollar-record-8C9PhkZISUeIV8FKqFjy3Q</link>
      <description>Gold surged to an unprecedented high just shy of $5,000 an ounce on Friday, as escalating geopolitical tensions and a weakening dollar propelled the precious metal toward a historic milestone. Spot gold rose to a record $4,967.48 per ounce, marking a nearly 15% gain since the start of 2026 and extending a rally that saw the metal climb roughly 64% last year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rally gained fresh momentum after President Donald Trump announced that a "massive" U.S. naval force is heading toward Iran, reigniting Middle East tensions that had briefly cooled following his retreat from Greenland tariff threats. "We have an armada. We have a massive fleet heading in that direction, and maybe we won't have to use it," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One returning from the World Economic Forum in Davos.</description>

      <title>US control of Venezuela oil threatens China's debt repayment</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/us-control-of-venezuela-oil-th-RfG.Kj4CTkO2.towhtlNdw</link>
      <description>The United States' takeover of Venezuela's oil exports has ensnared crude shipments that were servicing debt to China, setting the stage for a potential showdown between the two superpowers that could further complicate the South American nation's path out of default.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Around a tenth of Venezuela's $150 billion foreign debt pile is estimated to be loans from China that the OPEC member was paying in oil cargoes — until the US seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month. The Trump administration has announced that proceeds from Venezuelan oil sales will be directed to a Qatar-based account under Washington's control, potentially giving the US president substantial leverage over which creditors get paid and when.</description>

      <title>Bank of Japan holds rates steady, boosting Asian and US markets</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/boj-holds-rates-steady-boostin-oVDXGVqkR2qPLqhsbfj4Ag</link>
      <description>The Bank of Japan kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.75% on Friday, as expected, while raising its economic growth and inflation forecasts. The decision provided a stabilizing force for markets still recovering from a historic bond selloff earlier in the week triggered by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's snap election announcement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asian equities edged higher following the decision, with Japan's Nikkei 225 rising 0.2% to 53,800.28. U.S. futures also gained modestly, with S&amp;P 500 futures up 0.2%. South Korea's Kospi climbed 0.6%, trading just below the 5,000 milestone it crossed for the first time on Thursday.</description>

      <title>Greenland PM says he was not consulted on Trump-NATO deal</title>

      <description>The world's largest island has found itself at the intersection of climate science and geopolitical rivalry as NATO allies scramble to respond to U.S. President Donald Trump's renewed push to gain control of Greenland, even as new research underscores the territory's irreplaceable role in understanding global warming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, Trump announced a "framework for a future deal" regarding Greenland after meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, stepping back from earlier threats of military force or punitive tariffs against European nations opposing his acquisition efforts. Yet the specifics of this arrangement remain unclear to its most important stakeholder: Greenland itself.</description>

      <description>The European Parliament voted on Wednesday to refer the EU-Mercosur trade agreement to the European Court of Justice, dealing a blow to the bloc's largest trade pact just days after its signing ceremony in Paraguay and sparking a standoff with the European Commission over provisional implementation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The narrow vote—334 in favor, 324 against, with 11 abstentions—suspends the ratification process and could delay the deal by up to two years while judges in Luxembourg assess whether the agreement is compatible with EU treaties.</description>

      <title>Trump calls for 'immediate negotiations' to acquire Greenland</title>

      <description>In a hypothetical nuclear exchange involving the United States, Russia, and China, the vast Arctic territory of Greenland would sit directly in the crossfire. Its location—beneath the flight paths that intercontinental ballistic missiles would traverse between these nuclear powers—has made the semi-autonomous Danish territory a focal point of President Donald Trump's aggressive push to acquire it for his ambitious "Golden Dome" missile defense initiative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on January 21, Trump called for "immediate negotiations" to acquire Greenland, describing it as "this land on which we're going to build the greatest golden dome ever built." He added: "If there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice. Think of it: those missiles would be flying right over the centre."</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump announced a "framework" deal with NATO on Wednesday to expand US military access to Greenland, doubling down on his view that the Arctic island is essential to American space defense capabilities while backing off threats to use force in acquiring the territory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump characterized Greenland as "strategically vital" to US interests and emphasized its role in the American military's Space Force operations. "We're going to have the military we want," he told Fox Business following the announcement.</description>

      <description>At his first-ever appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Elon Musk proposed that sparsely populated regions of Spain and Sicily could be transformed into large-scale solar power hubs capable of generating electricity for the entire European continent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking Thursday in a conversation with Larry Fink, the chairman and CEO of BlackRock, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX argued that the technology for such ambitious projects already exists—what remains is the political will and investment to deploy it.</description>

      <description>As the World Economic Forum wrapped up in Davos this week, artificial intelligence's impact on jobs and a sharpening rivalry among leading AI companies emerged as the defining themes of the annual gathering of global elites.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's warnings of potential "civil unrest" to IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva describing AI's labor market impact as a "tsunami," the summit featured rare agreement among business leaders that workforce disruption is accelerating faster than society can adapt.</description>

      <description>As the world's largest island draws unprecedented geopolitical attention, Greenland's critical role in climate science and its vast but largely inaccessible mineral wealth face mounting challenges from logistical barriers, strict environmental regulations, and an uncertain political future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ice sheet covering roughly 80 percent of the island lost 105 billion metric tons of ice in the year ending August 2025, marking the 29th consecutive year of net ice loss, according to researchers from the Danish Meteorological Institute. Scientists warn that if Greenland's massive ice sheet were to fully melt, global sea levels could rise by approximately seven meters.</description>

      <description>Gold surged to within striking distance of $5,000 per troy ounce on Friday, reaching an intraday record of $4,970 in Asian trading, as markets responded to a whirlwind week of geopolitical developments including President Donald Trump's surprise reversal on tariff threats tied to Greenland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The precious metal has climbed roughly 11% in the first weeks of January alone, extending a historic 64% rally in 2025, as investors seek refuge from policy uncertainty and tensions continue across multiple global flashpoints.</description>

      <description>Shares of Nvidia rose in early trading Friday after Chinese regulators granted in-principle approval for the country's largest technology companies to begin preparing orders for the chipmaker's H200 artificial intelligence processors, a move suggesting Beijing is close to formally authorizing imports of the components critical to powering AI systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bloomberg reported that regulators have cleared Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance to move to the next stage of purchasing preparations, including negotiating specifics such as the quantities they would require. The development represents a meaningful shift in China's stance after weeks of uncertainty following a de facto import ban earlier in January.</description>

      <description>As global leaders gathered in Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum's 56th Annual Meeting this week, climate change discussions that once dominated the gathering took a back seat to geopolitics, artificial intelligence, and economic competition. The shift reflects a broader recalibration among business and political leaders who increasingly prioritize adaptation over ambitious emissions reduction goals.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump ignited fury across NATO allies on Thursday after claiming in a Fox News interview that troops from allied nations "stayed a little back, a little off the front lines" during the war in Afghanistan. The remarks drew immediate condemnation from British, Polish, Danish, and Canadian officials, as well as veterans who served in the conflict, prompting British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to call the comments "insulting and frankly appalling."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump questioned whether NATO would support the United States if called upon. "We've never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them," Trump said. "They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, and they did—they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines."</description>

      <description>As the World Economic Forum wrapped up its 56th Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on January 23, the gathering revealed a stark realignment: climate change discussions had retreated to the sidelines, while fossil fuels took center stage amid a fractured geopolitical landscape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump's address on January 21 set the tone. "There are windmills all over Europe, and they are failures," Trump told the audience of global executives and policymakers, branding green initiatives "the Green New Scam." He promoted oil and nuclear power, claiming U.S. natural gas production had reached record highs and oil output had risen by 730,000 barrels per day.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump announced Thursday that a US military "armada" is heading toward Iran, even as he expressed hope that the deployment would not be needed for further military action against Tehran.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We have an armada. We have a massive fleet heading in that direction, and maybe we won't have to use it. We'll see," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The deployment includes the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, several guided-missile destroyers, and fighter aircraft, which began moving from the Asia-Pacific region last week, according to US officials speaking to Reuters. The carrier strike group is expected to arrive in the Middle East in the coming days, with officials also considering additional air defense systems to protect US forces and bases in the region.</description>

      <description>Business leaders at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, projected optimism this week about artificial intelligence creating jobs despite stark warnings from global economic officials and rising worker anxiety about the technology's disruptive potential.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang emerged as a leading voice for AI optimism, telling attendees that the technology would generate employment across blue-collar trades. "Energy is creating jobs. Chips industry is creating jobs. The infrastructure layer is creating jobs," Huang said during a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. "Jobs, jobs, jobs."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Huang characterized the current AI buildout as "the largest infrastructure buildout in human history," predicting six-figure salaries for electricians, plumbers, and construction workers without needing "a Ph.D. in computer science."</description>

      <description>The first day of trilateral negotiations between Ukraine, Russia, and the United States concluded Friday in Abu Dhabi, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urging caution while the White House expressed measured optimism about the historic diplomatic effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It is still too early to draw conclusions about the content of today's negotiations; we will see how the talks go tomorrow and what the results will be," Zelensky said in his nightly address. The Ukrainian leader noted his negotiating team had provided updates "almost every hour" throughout the day but offered no details about specific discussions or progress.</description>

      <description>Uganda's military chief announced Friday that authorities have detained 2,000 opposition supporters and killed 30 people in an escalating crackdown following last week's contested presidential election in which his father, President Yoweri Museveni, won a seventh term.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who is also Museveni's son and widely believed to be his designated successor, disclosed the figures in a series of overnight social media posts, labeling members of the opposition National Unity Platform as "hooligans and terrorists." "So far we have killed 30 NUP terrorists," Kainerugaba wrote on X, without explaining the circumstances of the deaths. "Most NUP terrorist leaders are in hiding. We shall get them all," he added in another post.</description>

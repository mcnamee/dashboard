      <title>Morocco fossils illuminate split between humans, Neanderthals</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/773000-year-old-moroccan-fossi-2.BkisHTSjKasX5_P618xw</link>
      <description>Scientists unveiled Wednesday the discovery of 773,000-year-old hominin fossils in Morocco that may represent populations living near the evolutionary crossroads where modern humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans diverged—filling a critical gap in the African fossil record and reinforcing Africa as the birthplace of our species[1][2][3][4].

The fossils, published in Nature, were unearthed from Grotte à Hominidés, a cave at the Thomas Quarry I site near Casablanca[1][2][3]. An international research team led by Jean-Jacques Hublin of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany analyzed three partial jawbones—including one from a child—along with several vertebrae and teeth[1][2][5][6][3]. The remains display a mosaic of primitive features resembling Homo erectus and more modern traits seen in later humans[1][5][3].</description>

      <title>US seizes second Venezuelan oil tanker in Caribbean</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/us-seizes-second-venezuelan-oi-pKUhOZAbQJy2j0EYN9vPuQ</link>
      <description>U.S. forces seized a second sanctioned oil tanker linked to Venezuela on Wednesday, conducting back-to-back operations in the Caribbean and North Atlantic as President Donald Trump escalates enforcement of his blockade on Venezuelan oil exports.

The M/T Sophia, described by U.S. Southern Command as a "stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker," was apprehended in a predawn operation in international waters of the Caribbean Sea[1][2]. The Panama-flagged supertanker had departed Venezuelan waters in early January, operating with its transponder turned off in "dark mode" as part of a fleet carrying Venezuelan oil to China[3][4][5].</description>

      <title>Study finds aviation emissions could be cut by up to 75%</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/study-finds-aviation-emissions-q2uwe4JlSWipY0MS5WqrQw</link>
      <description>Global aviation emissions could be reduced by 50 to 75 percent through three efficiency strategies already within reach: deploying the most fuel-efficient aircraft, eliminating premium cabin seating, and filling more seats on each flight, according to a study published Tuesday in Nature Communications Earth &amp; Environment[1][2][3].

The research, co-led by the University of Oxford and Linnaeus University, analyzed more than 27 million commercial flights in 2023, revealing that airlines could achieve an 11 percent reduction in emissions immediately by better allocating their existing efficient aircraft on routes they already operate[1][2][3].

"Our results clearly show that efficiency-focused policy could swiftly reduce aviation emissions by more than half, without reducing flight numbers or waiting for future fuels," said co-author Dr. Milan Klöwer of Oxford's Department of Physics[2][3]. "These are tools that we can use right now."</description>

      <title>Interstellar comet releases water far from sun</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/interstellar-comet-3iatlas-sho-b4ndjZ_ERcijL3zxnRaB9A</link>
      <description>Astronomers have confirmed that the rare interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, not an alien spacecraft, following the most comprehensive radio signal search ever conducted on an object from beyond the solar system. The confirmation comes as new observations reveal the comet is releasing water at extraordinary rates and may be among the oldest objects ever observed, potentially dating back 7 to 14 billion years[1][2][3].

Results published this week from the Breakthrough Listen initiative show that multiple radio telescopes, including the Green Bank Telescope, detected no artificial signals during observations conducted as the comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025[1][4]. The Green Bank facility, the world's largest fully-steerable radio telescope, ruled out transmitters down to 0.1 watts—ten times weaker than a typical cell phone—during observations on December 18[1][5][6].</description>

      <title>Over 30 nations pledge Ukraine security guarantees at Paris summit</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/coalition-of-willing-summit-pr-dT_oHcNmTy.wbgf00yb_ww</link>
      <description>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed "concrete results" from a historic Paris summit where over 30 nations agreed to provide robust security guarantees in the event of a ceasefire with Russia, though critical issues including territorial disputes remain unresolved[1][2][3][4].

At Tuesday's Coalition of the Willing meeting, France and the United Kingdom signed a declaration committing to deploy troops and establish military hubs across Ukraine if a peace deal is reached[2][5][6]. French President Emmanuel Macron announced that Paris could deploy "several thousand" troops to monitor the Russia-Ukraine border and help regenerate Ukrainian armed forces, emphasizing these would not be combat forces[7][8][9].

The summit marked the first time the United States directly backed the coalition's security framework, with US envoy Steve Witkoff declaring that President Donald Trump "strongly, strongly stands behind security protocols"[2][10][11]. The American delegation, which included Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, reported "significant progress on several critical workstreams, including our bilateral security guarantee framework"[1][12][13].</description>

      <title>EU to suspend fertiliser tariffs and carbon levy</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/eu-considers-tariff-changes-an-Vf75zFH_SACVvNvIAugkCw</link>
      <description>The European Commission announced measures Wednesday to temporarily suspend tariffs and carbon levies on fertiliser imports following pressure from France and Italy to ease costs for struggling farmers.

EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic told agriculture ministers at a meeting in Brussels that the Commission will propose to temporarily suspend remaining most favored nation tariffs on ammonia, urea and other fertilisers[1][2]. The tariffs currently stand at 6.5% for ammonia and 5.5% for urea[1]. Additionally, the Commission will issue guidance allowing temporary suspension of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism on fertilisers, retroactive to January 1, 2026[3][4][5].

"Keeping fertilisers affordable is vital for farmers' incomes and Europe's food security," Sefcovic said at a press conference[1]. "While prices have stabilised, fertiliser costs remain around 60% higher than in 2020 and that is simply not sustainable."[1]</description>

      <description>Researchers have identified poison residues on 60,000-year-old arrowheads from South Africa, marking the earliest direct evidence of humans using poisoned weapons and pushing back this hunting practice by more than 50,000 years, according to a study published Tuesday in Science Advances[1][2][3].

The discovery at Umhlatuzana Rock Shelter in KwaZulu-Natal province reveals that early *Homo sapiens* possessed sophisticated knowledge of plant toxins and advanced cognitive abilities far earlier than previously documented[1][2][3]. Before this finding, the oldest confirmed poisoned arrows dated to approximately 7,000 years ago during the mid-Holocene period[1][4][5].</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order pulling the United States out of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the foundational 1992 treaty that underpins global climate cooperation and serves as the basis for the Paris Agreement[1][2][3][4].

The withdrawal from the UNFCCC marks the most dramatic step yet in Trump's campaign to disengage the US from international climate efforts. The move was part of a broader executive order suspending US support for 66 international organizations, agencies and commissions, according to a US official[2][5][4].</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump's administration is actively discussing the acquisition of Greenland from Denmark, with White House officials confirming that military action remains on the table despite diplomatic efforts taking priority[1][2][3]. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told lawmakers during a classified briefing this week that purchasing the territory is the administration's preferred approach, though he plans to meet with Danish officials next week after they requested an urgent meeting[2][4].

The renewed push comes as Trump frames Greenland as essential to U.S. national security, citing increased Russian and Chinese activity in the Arctic region[5][3]. Denmark, Greenland, and seven European nations have strongly rejected the proposal, with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warning that any military action would "mark the end of NATO"[6].</description>

      <title>Clean energy shift could save $12T by 2050, Oxford finds</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/clean-energy-shift-could-save-NR679qq2Skuq9WL4KOuJXg</link>
      <description>Australian farmer Brent Finlay stands beneath 45 towering wind turbines on his Queensland property, contemplating a remarkable transformation. Five years ago, a catastrophic drought turned his fertile land to dust, killing thousands of native kangaroos and forcing him to reconsider the future of his century-old family farm. Today, those same fields host part of the massive MacIntyre Wind Farm, generating power for 700,000 homes—and providing Finlay with crucial supplemental income as agriculture grows increasingly unpredictable[1][2].

His story reflects a broader economic shift gaining momentum worldwide. As renewable energy costs continue their precipitous decline, a rapid transition away from fossil fuels has emerged as not just an environmental imperative, but an enormous economic opportunity. According to a University of Oxford study, transitioning to renewable energy by 2050 could save the global economy at least $12 trillion in energy system costs compared to maintaining current fossil fuel use[3][4][5].</description>

      <title>Icebreaker reaches Thwaites Glacier to begin urgent drilling mission</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/icebreaker-araon-reaches-thwai-nsXsAOVISSiC9C69tU0q1g</link>
      <description>After navigating through unusually thick sea ice that threatened to derail the mission, the South Korean icebreaker Araon reached Antarctica's Thwaites Glacier on Wednesday, launching a critical scientific expedition to study one of the world's most vulnerable ice formations[1][1]. Nearly 40 international researchers are now racing against time to complete fieldwork that could reveal how quickly this Florida-sized glacier might contribute to global sea-level rise[1][2][3].

The 12-day voyage from New Zealand proceeded smoothly until Monday evening, when the vessel encountered an unexpectedly dense barrier of sea ice surrounding the Antarctic continent[1][4][1]. For hours, Captain Kim Gwang-heon and his crew maneuvered the 360-foot icebreaker through the frozen landscape, frequently reversing course when passages became blocked[1][3][1]. The ship groaned and shook as it collided with ice formations, creating sounds that resembled "being inside a washing machine," according to The New York Times[1][1]. Captain Kim, who remained awake for more than 30 hours navigating the treacherous conditions, expressed relief when the thickest ice finally dissipated around midnight Wednesday[1][5][1]. "We all possible for predicting conditions, it doesn't always go as planned," he said[1][1].</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/oil-prices-rise-on-us-inventor-BIRkYxN8Qy6rxHszibUs2w</link>
      <description>Oil prices rebounded on Thursday after a larger-than-expected drop in US crude inventories and developments in the Trump administration's efforts to control Venezuelan oil sales, though analysts warned that persistent oversupply concerns could cap further gains.

Brent crude futures rose 38 cents, or 0.6%, to $60.34 a barrel by early trading, while US West Texas Intermediate crude gained 37 cents, or 0.7%, to $56.36 a barrel, according to Reuters[1][2]. Both benchmarks had fallen more than 1% for two consecutive days earlier in the week.

The price uptick came after the US Energy Information Administration reported that commercial crude inventories fell by 3.8 million barrels to 419.1 million barrels in the week ended January 2, defying analysts' expectations for a 447,000-barrel increase[1][2][3][4]. The draw marked the largest decline since late October[5].</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/australian-antarctic-drill-rec-FhgFwEJeRa.1ZhNioE6dnQ</link>
      <description>A custom-built Australian drill has successfully extracted its first deep ice core from Antarctica, marking a pivotal milestone in a project to unlock climate secrets dating back more than one million years. The Australian Antarctic Division announced the achievement on January 7, following the extraction of a nearly one-meter core from 151 meters depth at a remote drilling site 1,200 kilometers inland from Casey research station[1][2][3].

The breakthrough comes after seven years of designing, building, and testing the 8.4-meter drill, which is engineered to operate in extreme conditions including temperatures as low as minus 55 degrees Celsius and pressures up to 300 kilograms per square centimeter[1][2][4]. The drill, adapted from a Danish design by Australian Antarctic Division scientists and engineers, is designed to ultimately reach ice more than 3,000 meters deep at the bedrock[2][3][4].</description>

      <title>Scientists locate gamma-ray source in solar flares</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/njit-scientists-identify-hidde-msg.ik4ZR9a8Yopzxy0dQA</link>
      <description>Researchers at the New Jersey Institute of Technology have identified a previously unknown source of intense gamma radiation produced during the sun's most powerful eruptions, solving a puzzle that has persisted for decades. The findings, published in Nature Astronomy on January 7, could improve space weather forecasting and enhance understanding of how solar flares unleash their extreme energy[1][2][3].

The discovery pinpoints a newly identified class of high-energy particles in the solar corona—the sun's upper atmosphere—as the origin of gamma-ray signals observed during major solar flare events. These particles, measured at energies of several million electron volts, are hundreds to thousands of times more energetic than typical flare particles and move near the speed of light[1][2][3].</description>

      <title>Russian drone strike leaves 800,000 without power</title>

      <description>A large-scale Russian drone attack late on January 7 left nearly 800,000 consumers without electricity in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region and more than one million people without water and heating as temperatures dropped below freezing[1][2][3].

The strikes on energy infrastructure knocked out power almost entirely in both Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions, according to Ukraine's Energy Ministry[4][5]. Acting Energy Minister Artem Nekrasov said repair work was underway as of the morning of January 8, with social and critical infrastructure facilities partially supplied with power[2][6].</description>

      <title>Microplastics disrupt atmosphere and oceans, weakening climate defenses</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/microplastics-threaten-atmosph-lFy1vmYWRk.vA5uS_yOCdw</link>
      <description>New research reveals microscopic plastic particles are accumulating in the atmosphere and oceans at far higher levels than previously estimated, disrupting critical natural systems that regulate Earth's climate.

Two studies published this week show microplastics are forming clouds over major cities and weakening the ocean's ability to absorb carbon dioxide, potentially accelerating global warming.</description>

      <title>Nvidia demands full payment upfront for China chip orders</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/nvidia-requires-upfront-paymen-pom4n1jGQP62CT9h_yYfvg</link>
      <description>Nvidia is requiring Chinese customers to pay in full for its H200 artificial intelligence chips before shipment, shifting financial risk away from the company as Beijing deliberates whether to approve imports of the advanced processors[1][2][3].

The chipmaker has imposed strict terms that prohibit cancellations, refunds, or configuration changes after orders are placed, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke to Reuters[1][2][3]. In special circumstances, customers may provide commercial insurance or asset collateral instead of cash, one person said[2]. The policy marks a departure from Nvidia's previous practice of allowing Chinese clients to place deposits rather than full payment upfront[2][3].

The stringent payment requirements come as China plans to approve some H200 imports as soon as this quarter for select commercial use, Bloomberg reported[4][5]. Chinese officials are preparing to allow domestic companies to buy the chips while barring them from military applications, sensitive government agencies, critical infrastructure, and state-owned enterprises on security grounds[4][6][5].

Chinese technology companies have placed orders for more than 2 million H200 chips priced at around $27,000 each, exceeding Nvidia's inventory of 700,000 units, Reuters reported last month[1][2][3]. The H200 delivers roughly six times the performance of the now-blocked H20 chip that Nvidia had designed specifically for the Chinese market[2][3][7].</description>

      <title>Stanford creates octopus-inspired skin that changes color and texture</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/stanford-unveils-octopus-inspi-lbAOgg9uStWARAkJvxX3Bw</link>
      <description>Stanford researchers have developed a flexible synthetic material capable of simultaneously changing both color and texture in seconds, mimicking the camouflage abilities of octopuses and marking what experts describe as one of the most sophisticated artificial camouflage systems ever created.

The breakthrough, published January 7 in Nature, represents the first material that can independently control both visual features on demand[1][2][3]. Lead author Siddharth Doshi, a doctoral student in materials science and engineering at Stanford, explained that the technology replicates essential elements of camouflage found in octopuses, cuttlefish, and squid across various environments[4][5].</description>

      <description>U.S. stocks retreated from record highs Wednesday as investors paused to reassess risk following a strong start to 2026, while oil prices stabilized after two days of declines and Samsung projected a record-breaking quarterly profit driven by surging demand for AI-related memory chips.

The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both reached fresh all-time intraday highs during Wednesday's session, with the Dow touching 49,509.92 and the S&amp;P 500 climbing to 6,953.00[1]. However, both indices retreated by the close, ending their three-day winning streaks[2][3]. The Nasdaq Composite edged slightly higher, supported by strength in large-cap technology stocks[2][3].</description>

      <title>China restricts rare earth exports to Japan despite civilian-use pledges</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/china-restricts-rare-earth-exp-wdzmjqI9ThexrpPYnszrxA</link>
      <description>China has begun restricting rare earth exports to Japanese companies despite official assurances that civilian users would remain unaffected, escalating a dispute triggered by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comments on Taiwan.

On Thursday, Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson He Yadong said the export ban on dual-use items to Japan would only impact military firms and that "civilian users will not be affected"[1][2][3]. However, The Wall Street Journal reported that China has started restricting exports of heavy rare earths and magnets broadly across Japanese industries since Tuesday, contradicting Beijing's official stance[4][5].

Japan lodged a formal protest Thursday when Vice Foreign Minister Takehiro Funakoshi met with Chinese Ambassador Wu Jianghao in Tokyo, demanding China withdraw the measures[6][7][8]. Wu rejected the protest, according to the Chinese embassy[1][9].</description>

      <title>China to approve Nvidia H200 chip imports this quarter</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/china-expected-to-approve-nvid-xRQ9cQpaS4ms_hbWnxh8ew</link>
      <description>China is preparing to authorize imports of Nvidia's H200 artificial intelligence chips as soon as this quarter, according to people familiar with the matter, marking a significant reopening of a market that has been largely cut off from the world's leading AI chip maker for more than two years[1][2][3].

Chinese officials are readying approval for domestic companies to purchase the chips for select commercial applications, the people said[1][2][4]. However, the military, sensitive government agencies, critical infrastructure operators, and state-owned enterprises will remain barred from using the H200 due to security concerns[1][2][4][5]—restrictions similar to those Beijing has previously imposed on products from Apple and Micron Technology[4][3].

Tech giants Alibaba and ByteDance have privately indicated interest in ordering more than 200,000 H200 units each once approval is granted, according to a person familiar with the matter[4][3][6]. The companies, along with Chinese AI startups including DeepSeek, are racing to upgrade their models to compete with OpenAI and other U.S. rivals[4][7][8].</description>

      <title>Swedish team makes hydrogen without platinum using conductive plastic</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/chalmers-scientists-produce-hy-WhaKNUL.SU.5bRJ2jU2Xkw</link>
      <description>Researchers at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden have developed a method to produce hydrogen gas using sunlight and water without platinum, potentially removing one of the most significant cost barriers in green hydrogen production. The breakthrough, published this week in the journal Advanced Materials, replaces the scarce and expensive metal with nanoparticles made from electrically conductive plastic[1][2][3][4].

The innovation addresses a critical challenge in the transition to renewable energy. While hydrogen produces only water as a byproduct when used, its production has long relied on platinum as a co-catalyst—a metal with limited global reserves concentrated primarily in South Africa and Russia, according to the research team[2][3]. The extraction process poses environmental and health risks, and platinum's scarcity has hampered efforts to scale green hydrogen production[2][3].</description>

      <title>Scientists map Milky Way neutrino flow to Earth</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/scientists-map-milky-way-neutr-1F4ZMz77TD.Q8W3E7kwn9Q</link>
      <description>Astrophysicists have produced the first comprehensive model of neutrino emissions from all stars in the Milky Way, providing researchers with a roadmap to detect these elusive particles and unlock new insights into stellar physics.

The study, published January 7 in Physical Review D, estimates how many neutrinos reach Earth from the galaxy's stars and pinpoints their origins[1][2][3][4]. Every second, a trillion neutrinos pass through the human body without interaction, earning them the nickname "ghost particles"[1][3][4].

"For the first time, we have a concrete estimate of how many of these particles reach Earth, where in the galaxy they come from, and how their energy is distributed," said lead author Pablo Martínez-Miravé, a postdoc at the University of Copenhagen's Niels Bohr Institute[1][3][4].</description>

      <title>Arctic sees surge in unprecedented extreme weather events</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/arctic-records-hottest-year-an-kWOng5ujQgiquRM2n01mQg</link>
      <description>The Arctic recorded its hottest year since measurements began 125 years ago, while a new study reveals the region has entered an unprecedented era of extreme weather events that threaten ecosystems and communities across the polar north.

Temperatures from October 2024 through September 2025 were the warmest in the Arctic since 1900, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's annual Arctic Report Card released in December[1][2][3]. The past decade represents the 10 warmest years on record for the region[1][2][3]. In March 2025, Arctic winter sea ice reached its lowest annual maximum extent in the 47-year satellite record[1][4][5].

Research published this week in the journal Science Advances documents a sharp increase in extreme weather events across the Arctic over the past 30 years[6][7][8]. The study, led by the Finnish Meteorological Institute with an international team including the University of Sheffield, found that approximately one-third of the Arctic land area has recently begun experiencing extreme weather events that had not occurred there previously[6][7][8].</description>

      <description>Shell shares dropped as much as 2.6% Thursday after the energy giant warned of weaker fourth-quarter trading results and losses in its chemicals division, raising doubts about whether the company can maintain its $3.5 billion quarterly share buyback program[1][2][3][4].

The London-based company said trading results for the fourth quarter of 2025 would be "significantly lower" than the previous three months, with its chemicals and products segment expected to swing to an adjusted loss[1][5][3][6]. Oil trading represents a major portion of Shell's trading operations, alongside refined products such as diesel and gasoline[1][3][7].</description>

      <description>Satellite observations and seismic monitoring have revealed alarming developments at two of Antarctica's most closely watched ice formations, raising fresh concerns about the stability of the continent's ice sheet and its potential contribution to sea level rise.

NASA's Terra satellite captured images on December 26, 2025, showing iceberg A-23A covered in extensive pools of blue meltwater, indicating the massive berg could disintegrate within days or weeks[1]. Separately, a study published in Geophysical Research Letters detected more than 360 glacial earthquakes near Antarctica's Thwaites Glacier between 2010 and 2023, with 245 concentrated at the marine end of the glacier known as the "Doomsday Glacier"[2][3][4].</description>

      <description>Australian researchers have discovered that trillions of microorganisms living in tree bark are silently removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, potentially amplifying the climate benefits of forests beyond their well-known carbon dioxide absorption.

A study published in Science reveals that bark-dwelling microbes consume methane, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide—all gases that contribute to global warming or enhance its effects[1][2]. The research, conducted over five years by teams from Monash University and Southern Cross University, examined eight common tree species across eastern Australia, including wetland, coastal, and upland forests[1][2].</description>

      <title>Rubio to meet with Danish, Greenland officials on Trump acquisition push</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-revives-push-to-buy-gree-ZTkT8Js3RaKQRjFUMxUBbQ</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump's renewed push to acquire Greenland intensified this week as U.S. officials discussed offering direct payments to residents and Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced plans to meet with Danish officials next week. The White House confirmed Wednesday that Trump and his national security team are "actively discussing" what a potential purchase would look like[1][2], despite firm rejections from both Denmark and Greenland.

According to four sources familiar with White House deliberations, U.S. officials have discussed sending lump-sum payments ranging from $10,000 to $100,000 per person to Greenland's 57,000 residents to encourage them to secede from Denmark and potentially join the United States[3][2]. At the upper end, such payments would total nearly $6 billion. The administration is also exploring a Compact of Free Association, similar to agreements with Pacific island nations, which would require Greenland to first become independent from Denmark[3][2].

Trump has justified his interest by citing national security concerns and the island's strategic Arctic location. "We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark isn't going to be able to do it," Trump told reporters Sunday[4][2]. The administration has not ruled out military intervention, though officials say they prefer diplomatic or economic means[1][5].</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/iran-protests-death-toll-climb-LHeuOupaQnODBIz4QdqEYQ</link>
      <description>At least 45 protesters, including eight minors, have been killed during 12 days of nationwide demonstrations in Iran, with Wednesday marking the deadliest single day of unrest as security forces killed 13 people, according to Norway-based Iran Human Rights[1]. The protests, which began in Tehran's Grand Bazaar on December 28 over economic grievances, have now spread to all 31 of Iran's provinces and evolved into broader calls for regime change[2][1].

Internet monitoring group NetBlocks reported a nationwide internet blackout on Thursday as authorities intensified efforts to suppress the demonstrations[3][4]. "The evidence shows that the scope of crackdown is becoming more violent and more extensive every day," said Iran Human Rights director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, adding that hundreds more have been wounded and over 2,000 arrested[1].</description>

      <title>UN says US must pay dues despite Trump order to quit 66 groups</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/un-urges-us-to-fund-agencies-a-KZ8P45JBSLKF1HPy0q5MvQ</link>
      <description>The United Nations said Thursday the United States has a legal obligation to continue funding U.N. agencies, one day after President Donald Trump signed an order withdrawing from 66 international organizations, including 31 affiliated with the world body[1][2][3].

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed regret over the decision and stressed that assessed contributions to the U.N. regular budget and peacekeeping operations "are a legal obligation under the UN Charter for all Member States, including the United States," according to spokesman Stephane Dujarric[1][4][5]. The statement came as U.N. officials said they learned of the withdrawal through news reports and White House social media posts Wednesday, with no formal notification from the Trump administration[1][2].

The executive order, which followed a yearlong review, targets organizations the White House says promote "radical climate policies, global governance, and ideological programs that conflict with U.S. sovereignty and economic strength"[6][7][8]. Among the 31 U.N. entities are the U.N. Population Fund, which provides reproductive health services in more than 150 countries, and UN Women, which promotes gender equality[1][2][9]. The order also directs withdrawal from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, the 1992 treaty that underpins the Paris climate agreement[6][1][2].

Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the move in a statement, saying the Trump administration determined the organizations were "redundant, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run" or advancing agendas inconsistent with U.S. interests[10][11][12]. The White House said the withdrawals would end American taxpayer funding for entities "that advance globalist agendas over U.S. priorities"[6][13][9].</description>

      <description>US President Donald Trump issued stark warnings to Iran on Thursday that Washington would respond with force if authorities continue killing peaceful protesters, as the Islamic Republic plunged into a nationwide internet blackout amid the largest demonstrations in more than three years.

Speaking with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on January 8, Trump declared that Iranian authorities would "have to pay hell" if they persist in lethal violence against demonstrators[1][2][3]. "I have let them know that if they start killing people, which they tend to do during their riots—they have lots of riots—if they do it, we are going to hit them very hard," Trump stated[2]. The warning came as human rights groups reported at least 39 to 45 protesters have been killed since demonstrations erupted in late December, including eight minors[4][5][6][7].

The protests, which began December 28 at Tehran's Grand Bazaar over economic grievances, have spread to all 31 provinces[4][8]. Violence intensified on Thursday evening after exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi called for coordinated demonstrations at 8 p.m. local time[9][5]. Witnesses reported crowds chanting "Death to the dictator" and "Pahlavi will return" across Tehran and other major cities[9][5].</description>

      <description>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has promised Russian President Vladimir Putin unconditional and permanent support for all his policies, according to a letter reported by state media KCNA on Friday[1][2][3][4][5].

"I will unconditionally respect and unconditionally support all your policies and decisions and I have a willingness to be always with you for the sake of you and your Russia," Kim wrote to Putin[1][2][5]. "This choice will be constant and permanent."

The letter, which KCNA said was a response to an earlier message from Putin, marks the latest expression of deepening ties between the two nations as North Korea provides critical military support to Russia's war in Ukraine[1][2][3][5].</description>

      <description>Cambodia's Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol said on Wednesday his country wants to "lower the temperature" with Thailand and pushed back against Bangkok's claims that recent border clashes were focused on combating scam centers, as both nations work to maintain a fragile 11-day-old ceasefire[1].

The comments come after Thailand and Cambodia signed a renewed ceasefire agreement on December 27, ending three weeks of fighting that killed at least 101 people and displaced more than half a million on both sides of the border[2][3]. Thailand released 18 Cambodian soldiers on December 31 who had been held as prisoners of war for 155 days, a move described by Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as "a gesture of goodwill and trust-building"[2].</description>

      <description>Two Russian Iskander ballistic missiles struck residential apartment buildings in Kryvyi Rih on Thursday evening, killing at least one person and wounding 24 others, including six children, in President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's hometown. The attack came as Russia continued its systematic targeting of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, leaving hundreds of thousands without power, water, and heating amid freezing temperatures[1][2][3][4].

The missiles hit the city around 5 p.m. local time, damaging approximately 15 apartment buildings and nearby vehicles[5][6][7]. Among the casualties was a 77-year-old woman who died in the strike, while the wounded included children aged 7 and 16[8][9]. One man who lost a leg in the explosion remained in critical condition and underwent surgery[5][8].</description>

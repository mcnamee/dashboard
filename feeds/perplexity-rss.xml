      <title>White House weighs Iran nuclear talks as Trump considers strikes</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/white-house-weighs-iran-nuclea-8B2aBGPBS8uiN8ZVRv0D0w</link>
      <description>The White House is considering Iran's proposal to enter nuclear negotiations even as President Donald Trump leans toward authorizing military strikes against the Islamic Republic, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter[1][2].

Trump announced Sunday that Iran had reached out to the United States the previous day proposing to negotiate a nuclear agreement[2][3]. "Iran reached out because they want to talk," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One[3]. The President indicated his administration was working to arrange a meeting with Tehran but warned he might need to take action beforehand as the death toll from protests continues to rise[3].

The overture arrives amid a brutal crackdown on nationwide demonstrations that erupted December 28 following the Iranian rial's collapse to a record low of 1.4 million to the dollar[4][5][6]. At least 538 people have been killed in the two-week uprising, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which has a history of accuracy during previous unrest in Iran[4][7]. More than 10,600 individuals have been arrested[7].</description>

      <title>Trump to meet Venezuelan opposition leader Machado at White House</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/venezuela-frees-over-100-polit-O8vUYtPWT3GmhF4b3zNMxQ</link>
      <description>Venezuela's interim government announced on Monday the release of 116 political prisoners, though human rights organizations have only been able to verify roughly half that number. The releases come after U.S. pressure following the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro by American forces earlier this month.

The discrepancy highlights ongoing tensions between the interim government's claims and the reality on the ground. The Penitentiary Services Ministry stated that those freed had been "deprived of their liberty for acts associated with disrupting the constitutional order and undermining the stability of the nation."[1][2] However, the human rights group Foro Penal reported that only 41 prisoners had been released as of Monday, including 24 freed overnight.[3][4] Another watchdog, Justicia, Encuentro y Perdón, confirmed 53 "duly verifiable" releases and called the current pace "clearly inadequate."[5][6]</description>

      <description>NASA is set to begin final preparations for humanity's return to lunar space this weekend, with the agency planning to roll the massive Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft to Kennedy Space Center's Launch Pad 39B on Saturday, January 17[1][2][3].

The 4-mile journey from the Vehicle Assembly Building will mark a critical milestone for Artemis II, the first crewed mission to the Moon since Apollo 17 in December 1972. If all goes according to plan, four astronauts could be launched toward the Moon as early as February 6[2][4].</description>

      <description>Britain is in discussions with NATO allies about strengthening military presence in the Arctic amid growing concerns over Russian and Chinese activity in the region, a UK government minister confirmed Sunday.

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander described the conversations as "business as usual" rather than a response to U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to acquire Greenland. "It's becoming an increasingly contested geopolitical region, with Russia and China … you would expect us to be talking to all our allies in NATO about what we can do to deter Russian aggression in the Arctic Circle," Alexander told Sky News[1][2].</description>

      <description>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Mexican Foreign Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente on January 11, 2026, in a call focused on dismantling drug trafficking networks and stopping the flow of fentanyl across the border. The conversation came days after President Donald Trump threatened to launch ground operations against Mexican cartels, remarks that have heightened tensions between the neighboring nations.[1][2]

The call was initiated at the instruction of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who on Friday directed de la Fuente to engage with U.S. officials to "strengthen coordination" under the existing bilateral security agreement.[3][4]</description>

      <title>Cornell study finds 70-year metal strength rule reverses at supersonic speeds</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/cornell-study-overturns-70-yea-IFBzb7YYSseh.cn7CvtrKw</link>
      <description>For more than seven decades, the Hall-Petch effect has guided engineers in strengthening metals: make the grains smaller, and the metal gets harder. But a new study from Cornell University has upended that foundational principle, revealing that at extreme speeds, smaller-grained metals actually become weaker.

The research, published January 12, 2026 in Physical Review Letters, found that when copper is deformed at supersonic velocities, the long-held relationship between grain size and strength reverses entirely[1][2].</description>

      <description>The world's largest island has become a flashpoint in an escalating geopolitical contest, as its melting ice sheet reveals both scientific warnings about climate change and vast mineral wealth coveted by global powers.

President Donald Trump's continued insistence that the United States will acquire Greenland "one way or the other" has thrust the sparsely populated Danish territory into the center of international tensions, even as researchers race to understand how its ice loss will reshape coastlines worldwide.[1][2]</description>

      <title>China, India cut coal power together for first time since 1970s</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/china-and-india-cut-coal-power-KZHeTZuSQguMVsUhJwsNSw</link>
      <description>For the first time in more than half a century, coal-fired power generation declined simultaneously in China and India last year, according to new analysis, marking what researchers call a "historic moment" in the global energy transition.

The concurrent reduction in coal-generated electricity in the world's two largest coal-consuming nations had not occurred since 1973, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), a Helsinki-based think tank. The analysis, commissioned by the UK climate news platform Carbon Brief, found that coal power generation in India fell by 3% in 2025, while China saw a 1.6% decline.[1][2][3]</description>

      <title>Zelensky warns of imminent Russian strike as Kyiv struggles to restore heat</title>

      <description>Emergency crews worked around the clock on Monday to restore heating and electricity to Kyiv residents more than three days after devastating Russian attacks on energy infrastructure, as President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that another large-scale assault could be imminent.

About 800 residential buildings in the Ukrainian capital remained without heating as of January 12, according to Mayor Vitali Klitschko[1], down from approximately 6,000 buildings that lost heat following a massive overnight assault on January 9 that killed at least four people and injured 25 others[2]. Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba reported that 85% of Kyiv's residential buildings have had heating restored[3][4].

"There is intelligence information. The Russians are preparing a new massive strike," Zelensky said in his evening video address. "Drones to exhaust air defense systems and missiles. They want to take advantage of the cold. The strike may occur in the coming days."[3][5]</description>

      <title>Russia strikes Ukraine power grid, cutting electricity to 7 regions</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/russia-attacks-ukraine-energy-HD.kzkDTTFGQDz_L65ip.g</link>
      <description>Russian forces struck Ukraine's energy infrastructure overnight on Monday, cutting power to seven regions as the country endures its fourth wartime winter under relentless bombardment. The attack left consumers in Odesa, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, and Chernihiv without electricity, according to Ukraine's Ministry of Energy[1][2].

Emergency blackouts were imposed in Kyiv and the surrounding region, as well as in Odesa, Kharkiv, and Donetsk oblasts. Authorities said a gradual transition from emergency restrictions to scheduled hourly shutdowns was underway in the capital[1].

The overnight assault extends a devastating week of Russian strikes targeting Ukraine's power grid. Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said not a single day had passed this week without attacks on energy facilities, with 44 strikes recorded in total[3][4].</description>

      <title>Over 200 U.S. scientists condemn Trump's Greenland acquisition push</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-faces-backlash-over-gree-PWAGlRDvQWOAynvSUktgXQ</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump's renewed push to bring Greenland under American control has drawn fierce opposition from European allies and a coordinated rebuke from more than 200 U.S. scientists, even as mining experts say the island's mineral wealth may be far more difficult to access than the administration suggests.

"We are going to do something on Greenland whether they like it or not," Trump declared on Friday during a White House meeting with oil executives[1][2]. "If we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way."

The remarks, coming days after U.S. military forces removed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on January 3, have alarmed European leaders and prompted Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to declare that her country faces a "decisive moment" in its diplomatic struggle with Washington[3][4].</description>

      <description>Asian currencies weakened broadly on Tuesday as traders grappled with fresh tariff warnings from President Donald Trump targeting countries that do business with Iran, while rising oil prices and concerns over the Federal Reserve's independence added to regional market pressures.

The Japanese yen fell to a one-year low against the dollar, while the Indian rupee and South Korean won also declined, according to Investing.com [1]. The selloff came after Trump announced Monday that any country doing business with Iran would face a 25% tariff on U.S. trade, escalating economic pressure as anti-government protests spread across the Middle Eastern nation.</description>

      <description>A series of discoveries announced this week are reshaping astronomers' understanding of the early universe, revealing unexpected heat, unusual galaxy types, and cosmic structures that defy existing models of how the first galaxies formed and evolved.

Research published January 12 in Nature Astronomy describes a massive galaxy that "lived fast and died young" after its supermassive black hole slowly starved it of the cold gas needed to form new stars. Meanwhile, separate findings presented at the 247th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Phoenix show galaxy clusters far hotter than predicted and objects so strange that scientists are comparing them to the platypus.[1][2][3]</description>

      <description>Mobile phones in Iran were able to call abroad on Tuesday after a deadly crackdown on nationwide protests in which the government severed both internet access and international calling capabilities, according to the Associated Press. Several people in Tehran were able to reach an AP journalist, though the news agency's bureau in Dubai could not call those numbers back[1][2].

The partial restoration comes as the country enters its fifth day of a near-total communications blackout that has isolated millions of Iranians from the outside world. According to NetBlocks, the internet monitoring organization, connectivity throughout the country remains at just 1% of normal levels[3][4]. Text messaging appeared to remain down, and witnesses confirmed the internet was still inaccessible[1][2].</description>

      <description>Despite being half the size of Earth and only one-tenth its mass, Mars exerts a measurable influence on our planet's long-term climate patterns, including the timing of ice ages, according to new research published this week.

The study, led by Stephen Kane, a professor of planetary astrophysics at the University of California, Riverside, used computer simulations to model how Earth's orbit and axial tilt would behave with and without Mars present in the solar system. The findings, published in Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, reveal that two major climate cycles vanish entirely when the red planet is removed from the equation.[1][2]</description>

      <description>Water-related disasters caused nearly 5,000 deaths, displaced 8 million people, and resulted in economic losses exceeding US$360 billion during 2025, according to a new international report that attributes these catastrophes to an increasingly unstable global water cycle driven by rapid warming.

The 2025 Global Water Monitor Report, released Sunday by researchers led by Professor Albert van Dijk at The Australian National University's Fenner School of Environment and Society, documents how shifts in rainfall patterns, atmospheric moisture, and temperature combined to amplify floods, droughts, and heat extremes worldwide[1][2][3].</description>

      <title>Heat waves overwhelm honey bees' ability to cool hives, study finds</title>

      <description>A new study reveals that intensifying heat waves are overwhelming honey bees' natural ability to cool their hives, causing population declines that could threaten global pollination services. The research, published on January 12 in the journal Ecological and Evolutionary Physiology, is the first to assess how natural heat waves affect honey bee colonies' capacity to regulate temperature and maintain healthy populations.[1][2]

The findings arrive as commercial beekeepers across North America already face colony losses potentially reaching 60 to 70 percent in recent years, according to Washington State University entomologists, underscoring the urgency of understanding how climate change compounds existing threats to these critical pollinators.[3]</description>

      <title>Irish researchers reveal how early black holes grew to monstrous sizes</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/maynooth-researchers-and-nasa-ngZAVjHOQEaCRFLlp4IERA</link>
      <description>A pair of studies published this week have delivered answers to long-standing cosmic mysteries, revealing how early black holes grew to monstrous sizes and clarifying where the bright glow around supermassive black holes actually originates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers at Ireland's Maynooth University reported in Nature Astronomy on Tuesday that the chaotic conditions of the early universe allowed small black holes to undergo "feeding frenzies," growing into supermassive objects tens of thousands of times the mass of the sun in just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>Astronomers detect iron cloud, mystery object dimming distant star</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/astronomers-find-giant-iron-cl-ngPsSbaVRai0X7BHwIl76A</link>
      <description>Two separate teams of astronomers have announced the discovery of unusual metallic structures in space, offering rare insights into the chaotic processes shaping planetary systems and the deaths of stars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In findings announced Tuesday by the U.S. National Science Foundation's NOIRLab, researchers detected sweeping winds of vaporized metals orbiting a mystery object that dimmed a sun-like star for nearly nine months. Meanwhile, a European team revealed the presence of a massive bar-shaped cloud of iron atoms hidden inside the iconic Ring Nebula, despite centuries of observation.</description>

      <description>NASA's massive Artemis II rocket now stands at Launch Pad 39B at Kennedy Space Center, where engineers are conducting final preparations ahead of a critical fueling test that will determine whether the first crewed lunar mission in more than 50 years can launch next month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft arrived at the Florida launch pad on January 17 after a nearly 12-hour journey from NASA's Vehicle Assembly Building, traveling at a maximum speed of just 0.82 mph aboard one of the agency's crawler transporter vehicles. Since then, technicians have been working to ready the 322-foot-tall rocket for its upcoming wet dress rehearsal, scheduled for no later than February 2.</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/southeast-asia-coal-demand-sur-OzVNTAfBTiaVbXHGLvflCw</link>
      <description>Southeast Asia's demand for coal is growing faster than anywhere else in the world, undermining efforts to cut carbon emissions even as the region faces mounting climate change impacts, according to the International Energy Agency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regional coal consumption will rise by more than 4% annually through the end of the decade, the IEA reported in its latest coal market analysis. Indonesia, the world's largest coal exporter, will account for more than half of that growth, followed by Vietnam, which hit a record high of 65.43 million metric tonnes of coal imports in 2025.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump formally unveiled his "Board of Peace" initiative at a signing ceremony during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, calling it "a very exciting day, long in the making" as he stood alongside leaders from nearly 20 nations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We're going to have peace in the world," Trump declared. "And we're all stars." The ceremony marks the official launch of an initiative originally conceived to oversee Gaza's reconstruction but which has since expanded into a far broader organization aimed at mediating global conflicts.</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-administration-actively-STjSiqYlTLS_xIFOtthMsg</link>
      <description>The Trump administration is actively pursuing regime change in Cuba before the end of 2026, seeking insiders within the Communist government who might be willing to negotiate an end to nearly seven decades of one-party rule, according to a report published Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The effort, emboldened by the January 3 capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, marks a sharp escalation in Washington's pressure campaign against Havana. U.S. officials told the Journal they believe Cuba's economy is "nearing collapse" and that the government has never been more vulnerable, particularly after losing its main oil supplier in Caracas.</description>

      <title>Zelensky slams Europe's 'lack of political will' on Russia at Davos</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/zelensky-criticizes-europe-for-R6QojXJIQYaCIRdFgmpbNw</link>
      <description>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a sharp critique of European leaders during his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, accusing the European Union of lacking "political will" in dealing with Russia and warning that the continent has made no progress on self-defense in the past year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Just last year, here in Davos, I ended my speech with the words: Europe needs to know how to defend itself. A year has passed. And nothing has changed," Zelensky told the gathering of global leaders and business executives. "Instead of becoming a truly global power, Europe remains a beautiful but fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers," he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Ukrainian leader accused European nations of preferring discussion over action. "Europe loves to discuss the future but avoids taking action today — actions that determine what future we will have, that is the problem," Zelensky said. He specifically criticized European leaders for blocking the use of frozen Russian assets to help fund Ukraine's defense.</description>

      <description>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a blistering speech at the World Economic Forum on Thursday, accusing European allies of paralysis in the face of Russian aggression while announcing the first trilateral meeting between Ukraine, the United States, and Russia would take place in the UAE starting Friday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking shortly after an hour-long meeting with US President Donald Trump in Davos, Zelensky said Europe was "living in Groundhog Day," stuck in a pattern of inaction nearly four years into Russia's invasion. "Just last year here in Davos, I ended my speech with the words Europe needs to know how to defend itself. A year has passed and nothing has changed," he said.</description>

      <description>Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings launched its first reactor since the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster on Wednesday evening, only to suspend operations hours later after an alarm sounded during startup procedures—underscoring the persistent technical challenges facing Japan's nuclear revival.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The No. 6 reactor at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant in Niigata Prefecture was reactivated at 7:02 p.m. local time on Wednesday and reached criticality around 90 minutes later. But at 12:28 a.m. Thursday, an alarm from a control rod monitoring system triggered a halt to operations, forcing TEPCO to suspend the withdrawal of control rods essential for regulating nuclear fission.</description>

      <description>Google is expanding its "Personal Intelligence" AI feature to its flagship search engine's AI Mode, allowing the company's Gemini chatbot to analyze users' emails, photos, and YouTube history to deliver customized search results. The expansion, announced Wednesday, follows the initial January 14 rollout of Personal Intelligence in the standalone Gemini app.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The feature marks a significant shift in how Google handles user data for AI-powered services. When enabled, Gemini can reason across a user's Gmail, Google Photos, and YouTube viewing history to provide tailored answers to search queries—from finding license plate numbers stored in photos to suggesting vacation destinations based on past travel patterns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Personal Intelligence securely connects information from apps like Gmail and Google Photos to make Gemini uniquely helpful," Josh Woodward, Google's vice president overseeing the Gemini app, wrote in a blog post. "You control exactly which apps to link, and each one supercharges the experience."</description>

      <description>Moderna will not invest in new late-stage vaccine trials due to growing opposition to immunizations from US officials, Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel announced at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"You cannot make a return on investment if you don't have access to the US market," Bancel told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday, explaining that regulatory delays and lack of support from US health officials are making the potential market size "much smaller."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The announcement reflects the deepening chill across the vaccine industry as anti-vaccine rhetoric under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has translated into concrete policy changes over the past year.</description>

      <description>An international research team has discovered a supermassive black hole in the early universe growing at 13 times the theoretical speed limit, challenging current models of how these cosmic giants form and evolve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The discovery, announced Wednesday by scientists at Waseda University and Tohoku University in Japan, used observations from the Subaru Telescope to measure gas motion around a black hole that existed when the universe was less than 1.5 billion years old. The findings, published in The Astrophysical Journal, reveal an object accreting matter at rates that defy conventional astrophysics.</description>

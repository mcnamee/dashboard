      <title>Richest 1% exhausted 2026 carbon budget in 10 days, Oxfam says</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/richest-1-percent-exceed-2026-cheiYNomQ9e4KXbf2hwPXA</link>
      <description>The richest 1 percent of the world's population exhausted their annual carbon emissions allowance just 10 days into 2026, according to research released by Oxfam on January 10. The finding underscores growing concerns about climate inequality as governments face mounting pressure to impose wealth taxes and restrict luxury carbon consumption.

Oxfam designated January 10 as "Pollutocrat Day," the date when the wealthiest exceeded safe emission limits needed to keep global warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, as outlined in the Paris Agreement[1]. The analysis, using data from the Stockholm Environment Institute, found the richest 1 percent emit 75.1 tonnes of carbon dioxide per person annually, or 0.206 tonnes daily[1]. In stark contrast, someone from the poorest half of the global population would take nearly three years to use their carbon allowance[2][3].

The ultra-wealthy crossed this threshold even faster. The richest 0.1 percent depleted their annual budget by January 3, just three days into the new year[4][1].</description>

      <title>Greenland parliament unites to reject Trump acquisition threats</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/greenland-s-natural-resources-iMBm0oduROCZPBtraTk5.Q</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump intensified his push to acquire Greenland on Friday, declaring the United States will "do something on Greenland whether they like it or not," as the world's largest island becomes a flashpoint for geopolitical tensions over its vast mineral wealth and strategic Arctic position[1][2][3].

All five political parties in Greenland's parliament issued a unified rejection hours later. "We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders," the leaders stated in a rare joint declaration, announcing an expedited parliamentary session to address the escalating U.S. threats[2][4]. The island's 57,000 residents have consistently rejected Trump's overtures, with Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen reiterating that "Greenland is not for sale"[1][3].</description>

      <title>Astronomers reveal 'ghost galaxy' and platypus galaxies</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/astronomers-discover-mysteriou-FcFCo.KQS1GhHlS0CS6RIw</link>
      <description>Astronomers presented two groundbreaking discoveries this week at the 247th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Phoenix, unveiling celestial objects that challenge prevailing theories about how galaxies form and evolve.

Using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, researchers confirmed the first-ever detection of a starless dark matter cloud dubbed Cloud-9, located 14 million light-years from Earth near the spiral galaxy Messier 94[1][2][3][4][5][6]. The object represents a category called Reionization-Limited H I Clouds, or RELHICs—theoretical "failed galaxies" that never accumulated enough gas to ignite star formation[1][2][3][7][8][9].

"This is a tale of a failed galaxy," said Alejandro Benitez-Llambay, an astrophysicist at the University of Milano-Bicocca in Milan, Italy, who serves as the study's principal investigator[1][10][11]. The findings, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters in November 2025, were presented Monday at the conference[1][8][11].

Cloud-9's core spans roughly 4,900 light-years and contains about one million solar masses of neutral hydrogen gas[1][3][8]. Yet calculations suggest the cloud sits within a dark matter halo weighing approximately five billion solar masses—mass that provides gravitational structure without producing visible light[1][3][12].

"Cloud-9 gives us a rare look at a dark-matter-dominated cloud," said Andrew Fox, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute for the European Space Agency[1][3][13].

The discovery began three years ago when China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope detected the hydrogen cloud during a radio survey[1][2][3][4][14][15]. Subsequent observations from the Green Bank Telescope and Very Large Array confirmed the gas presence, but only Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys could definitively rule out stars[1][3][4][8][13].

"Before we used Hubble, you could argue that this is a faint dwarf galaxy that we could not see with ground-based telescopes," said lead author Gagandeep Anand of the Space Telescope Science Institute[3][13][12]. "But with Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys, we're able to nail down that there's nothing there."</description>

      <title>Venezuela frees 18 political prisoners after Maduro capture</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/venezuela-releases-political-p-qBE0PiADTwarTbJy6rWjow</link>
      <description>Venezuela has released 18 political prisoners as of Saturday morning, following the U.S. military capture of President Nicolás Maduro one week earlier[1][2]. The prisoner releases mark the first concessions by Venezuela's interim government since U.S. forces seized Maduro in a raid on Caracas on January 3[3][4][5].

President Donald Trump announced Friday that he had canceled a planned "second wave of attacks" on Venezuela after the country began freeing detainees[3][6][7]. "Venezuela is releasing large numbers of political prisoners as a sign of 'Seeking Peace,'" Trump wrote on Truth Social, calling it "a very important and smart gesture"[3][8][7]. Trump said the U.S. and Venezuela "are working well together, especially as it pertains to rebuilding, in a much bigger, better, and more modern form, their oil and gas infrastructure"[3][7].

Jorge Rodríguez, president of Venezuela's National Assembly and brother of interim president Delcy Rodríguez, announced Thursday that a "significant number" of prisoners would be released immediately as a gesture to promote "peaceful coexistence"[3][5][9]. He did not specify how many would be freed or provide names[3][4][5].</description>

      <title>Iran Guards call security a 'red line' amid 13th day of protests</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/iran-revolutionary-guards-warn-C5NFoUDcQyW_dpt6fQHabw</link>
      <description>Iran's Revolutionary Guards declared Saturday that safeguarding security is a "red line" as authorities escalated efforts to crush the largest anti-government protests in years, now entering their 13th consecutive day amid a nationwide internet blackout and mounting international pressure.

The warning from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, broadcast on state television, came as protests that began over soaring inflation on December 28 have evolved into calls for an end to clerical rule[1][2][3]. The elite force accused "terrorists" of targeting military and law enforcement bases and said continued unrest was "unacceptable"[1][4].</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/us-launches-large-scale-airstr-.cxRCee4RnqztYsxh4iWhQ</link>
      <description>The United States and allied forces conducted extensive airstrikes against Islamic State targets across Syria on Saturday afternoon, firing more than 90 precision munitions at over 35 locations in the second major wave of a sustained military campaign to retaliate for the killing of three Americans last month[1][2][3][4][5].

The strikes, carried out at approximately 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time, involved more than 20 aircraft including F-15E Strike Eagles, A-10 Warthogs, AC-130J gunships, MQ-9 Reaper drones, and Jordanian F-16s, according to U.S. Central Command[1][4]. The military operation is part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, authorized by President Donald Trump on December 19 in response to a deadly ISIS ambush near Palmyra that killed two Iowa National Guard soldiers and a U.S. civilian interpreter on December 13[1][2][3][5].</description>

      <description>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian pledged to overhaul his country's struggling economy on Sunday while accusing the United States and Israel of orchestrating nationwide protests that have left more than 160 dead, according to multiple reports.

In a televised address, Pezeshkian struck a conciliatory tone, saying his government is "ready to heed the voice of its people" and is "determined to resolve economic problems by any means possible"[1][2][3][4][5]. However, he urged Iranians to distance themselves from what he called "rioters and terrorists," claiming foreign powers are exploiting legitimate grievances to destabilize the country[1][2][6].</description>

      <title>Iran warns US bases, Israel are 'legitimate targets'</title>

      <description>Iran's parliament speaker issued a stark warning Sunday that American military bases across the Middle East and Israel would be considered "legitimate targets" if the United States launches strikes against the Islamic Republic, as President Donald Trump weighs military options to support anti-government protesters.

Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, speaking during a heated parliamentary session broadcast on state television, told lawmakers that Tehran would not limit itself to retaliatory strikes. "In the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centers, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets," he said, using Iran's term for Israel[1][2][3]. "We do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat."

As Qalibaf spoke, lawmakers rushed the parliament dais chanting "Death to America," marking a sharp escalation in tensions[1][4].</description>

      <title>Iran protest death toll exceeds 500 amid crackdown, rights group says</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/iran-protest-death-toll-exceed-yb.PM.8xTOSlZI49JWD3xg</link>
      <description>The death toll from two weeks of anti-government protests in Iran has climbed above 500, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, as authorities impose a nationwide internet blackout and threaten demonstrators with the death penalty.

HRANA reported Sunday that 490 protesters and 48 security force members have been killed since demonstrations erupted on December 28, with approximately 10,000 people arrested[1][2][3][4]. Reuters could not independently verify the figures, and Iranian authorities have not released official casualty counts[1][2][3]. Some reports suggest the actual toll may be far higher, with one Tehran doctor telling TIME that at least 217 deaths had been recorded across six hospitals in the capital alone[5].

Medical staff at hospitals in Tehran, Rasht, and Shiraz described facilities overwhelmed by the wounded and dead. A hospital worker in Tehran told the BBC that casualties were so numerous that "there wasn't enough space in the morgue; the bodies were placed on top of one another"[6][7]. Another medic reported security forces firing "direct shots to the heads of the young people, to their hearts as well"[6][7]. BBC Persian verified that approximately 70 bodies were brought to Poursina Hospital in Rasht on Friday night, exceeding morgue capacity[7][8].</description>

      <title>Britain weighs Greenland deployment as Trump threatens seizure</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/uk-and-europe-consider-militar-mn0Ler2kS4W8OED5nDdb9A</link>
      <description>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is weighing military options in Greenland following escalating threats by US President Donald Trump to seize the Danish territory, with UK officials pursuing an urgent diplomatic strategy to defuse the most serious NATO crisis in the alliance's history.

Trump declared Friday that the United States would "do something on Greenland whether they like it or not," refusing to rule out military force to acquire the semi-autonomous Arctic island[1][2]. The Daily Mail reported Sunday that Trump has ordered special forces commanders to draw up invasion plans, though senior military officials are reportedly resisting the directive as unlawful[3][4].

The Telegraph reported Saturday that military planners are developing proposals for a potential NATO mission to Greenland that could involve British troops, warships and aircraft[5][6]. Downing Street has held discussions with German and French counterparts in recent days about deploying forces to demonstrate that Europe can address Arctic security concerns, according to British officials[7][5].</description>

      <title>Denmark to meet US on Greenland as Trump threats escalate</title>

      <description>Denmark confirmed Sunday that Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen will meet with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio next week to discuss Greenland, as tensions escalate over President Donald Trump's repeated threats to take control of the Arctic territory[1][2].

"We are at a crossroads," Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said during a party conference, according to the Ritzau news agency[1][2]. The meeting comes after Denmark and Greenland requested talks with Rubio following intensifying rhetoric from the Trump administration, which has refused to rule out military force to acquire the mineral-rich island[3][4][5].

Trump said Friday that the US would "do something on Greenland whether they like it or not," adding that if America doesn't act, "Russia or China will take over Greenland"[6][7][8]. The White House confirmed Tuesday it is "discussing a range of options" to acquire Greenland, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt stating that "utilizing the U.S. military is always an option"[9][10].</description>

      <title>Iran protest death toll surpasses 500 under internet blackout</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/iran-protest-death-toll-surpas-6eC6wnoFT3m42FcYcb3hqg</link>
      <description>Two weeks of nationwide protests in Iran have left more than 500 people dead as authorities intensified their crackdown under the cover of a near-total internet blackout, according to rights groups monitoring the unrest that has evolved into one of the most serious challenges to the Islamic Republic's theocratic government in years.

The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported Sunday that at least 538 people have been killed, including 490 protesters and 48 security personnel[1][2][3]. More than 10,600 people have been arrested[1][2][4][3]. The Norway-based Iran Human Rights organization separately documented 192 deaths, warning the actual toll could be significantly higher as the ongoing communications blackout has made verification increasingly difficult[5][6].

The protests erupted on December 28 following the collapse of Iran's currency, the rial, which now trades at over 1.4 million to one U.S. dollar as the country's economy buckles under international sanctions[4][3][7]. What began as demonstrations over economic hardship has transformed into direct challenges to Iran's theocratic regime, with protesters chanting "Death to Khamenei" in reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei[8][9].</description>

      <title>Von der Leyen backs Iran protesters, condemns crackdown</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/von-der-leyen-backs-iranian-pr-1rr_3k6ZRV.v4VG2jYJeBg</link>
      <description>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed full support for anti-government protesters in Iran on January 10, condemning the violent crackdown by authorities and calling for the immediate release of detained demonstrators and restoration of internet access[1][2][3][4][5][6].

"Tehran's streets, and cities around the world, echo with the footsteps of Iranian women and men demanding freedom," von der Leyen wrote on social media[2][3][6]. "Europe stands fully behind them. We unequivocally condemn the violent repression of these legitimate demonstrations. Those responsible will be remembered on the wrong side of history."[3][4][6]

The statement comes as Iran faces its most widespread unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, according to observers[7][8]. Protests erupted December 28 after the Iranian rial collapsed to over 1.4 million against the U.S. dollar, triggering demonstrations by Tehran bazaar merchants that quickly spread to at least 27 provinces[9][7][10][11].

Human rights groups report escalating violence under a nationwide internet blackout imposed January 8[12][13][14]. The Human Rights Activists in Iran documented at least 538 deaths, including 490 protesters and 48 security forces members, as of January 10[15]. The organization's data, based on activist networks inside the country, has proven accurate in previous unrest[16].</description>

      <description>Reza Pahlavi, the U.S.-based son of Iran's last shah, has declared he is "preparing to return to Iran" to lead a democratic transition as anti-regime protests enter their third week, marking a significant shift from passive supporter to active opposition leader attempting to direct a movement that has left at least 538 people dead[1][2][3].

The 63-year-old announced his readiness to return on January 10, telling Fox News he would lead the transition "to make sure that in full transparency, people have an opportunity to elect their leaders freely and to decide their own future"[4]. His calls for coordinated demonstrations at 8 p.m. local time on January 8 and 9 drew large crowds to the streets of Tehran and other cities, with protesters chanting "Long live the shah" and "Pahlavi will return"[5][6][7].

Pahlavi has moved beyond issuing statements from exile to providing tactical guidance, urging demonstrators to "seize and hold city centers," stay together on main streets, and maintain discipline[6][7]. He has also called for nationwide strikes among energy and transportation workers, seeking to apply economic pressure on the Islamic Republic[8]. Videos verified by monitoring groups showed thousands responding to his appeals despite a nationwide internet blackout imposed by authorities[5][2].</description>

      <title>Iran protest death toll reaches 544, over 10,600 arrested</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/iran-protests-intensify-with-d-WyJv6iZVQIWwXLS5YN3tzA</link>
      <description>Nationwide protests in Iran have entered their third week, with the death toll rising to at least 544 as security forces intensify a violent crackdown on demonstrators calling for the end of the Islamic Republic, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency[1]. The unrest, which has spread to 185 cities across all 31 provinces, represents one of the most serious challenges to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's regime since the 1979 revolution[2][3].

HRANA reported Sunday that more than 10,600 people have been arrested since protests erupted on December 28, when Iran's currency plummeted to historic lows against the U.S. dollar[4][1]. The agency, which has a history of accurate reporting during previous Iranian unrest, confirmed 490 protester deaths and 48 security force fatalities, though the actual toll may be higher due to a nationwide internet blackout imposed January 8[2][5].

President Donald Trump has been briefed on military strike options for Iran and warned Tehran he would hit the regime "very, very hard where it hurts" if it continues killing protesters[6][7]. Iran's parliament speaker responded by threatening that U.S. troops and Israel would become "legitimate targets" if America intervenes militarily[8][4].</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/japan-launches-deep-sea-rare-e-tXRpUUS4Qma6yznxmaPu2Q</link>
      <description>A Japanese research vessel departed Monday for a remote Pacific atoll to begin the world's first attempt to extract rare earths from deep-sea mud, as Tokyo accelerates efforts to reduce its dependence on China following Beijing's latest export restrictions.

The deep-sea scientific drilling ship Chikyu set sail from the port city of Shizuoka bound for Minamitori Island, approximately 1,900 kilometers southeast of Tokyo, for a month-long mission to retrieve mineral-rich sediment from depths of 6,000 meters, according to Reuters[1][2]. The voyage marks a first-of-its-kind effort to continuously lift rare-earth material from such depths to a ship.</description>

      <description>Brazilian actor Wagner Moura made Golden Globe history on Sunday night, becoming the first Brazilian man to win Best Actor in a Drama for his performance in "The Secret Agent," a political thriller set during Brazil's 1977 military dictatorship. The film also captured the Best Non-English Language Motion Picture award, cementing a triumphant night for Brazilian cinema at the Beverly Hilton.

"I was not prepared for this because I thought I was too old," Moura, 49, said during his acceptance speech, as reported by the Los Angeles Times[1]. The actor, who arrived on the red carpet in a white double-breasted jacket alongside his partner of nearly 30 years, Sandra Delgado, thanked his wife first in his remarks[2][3].</description>

      <title>Gold hits record high amid Fed probe, Iran unrest</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/gold-hits-record-4600-amid-fed-RP4SHOI.S9KVBIFp_GnkbA</link>
      <description>Gold surged past $4,600 per ounce for the first time on Monday, as investors rushed into safe-haven assets following the U.S. Justice Department's criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and escalating violence from protests in Iran.

Spot gold jumped as much as 1.7% to reach a record high of $4,600.33 per ounce in Asian trading, according to Reuters[1][2]. Silver also climbed to an all-time high of $84.60 per ounce before settling around $83-84, extending a rally that has seen the white metal gain nearly 150% over the past year[3][4].

"So, between events in Iran, and potential U.S. involvement, and the (Fed) chair being the focus of a criminal probe... U.S. futures turned lower on the Powell news, which was a green light for gold to take a run higher," said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade[1].</description>

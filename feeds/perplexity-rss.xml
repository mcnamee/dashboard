      <title>UK's Starmer says Britain won't choose between US and China</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/starmer-says-uk-won-t-choose-b-h4y4KIGHTgGxw_8_sMVOsA</link>
      <description>Prime Minister Keir Starmer declared on Monday that the United Kingdom would not be forced to choose between the United States and China, highlighting what he called "significant opportunities" for British businesses as he prepares to depart for Beijing this week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an interview with Bloomberg, Starmer dismissed questions about whether strengthening ties with China would come at the expense of Britain's relationship with its closest allies. The trip, which marks the first official visit by a British prime minister to China since Theresa May's 2018 journey, represents a key moment in Starmer's bid to reset Sino-British relations.</description>

      <title>Moore's Law era ends as chip industry shifts to new strategies</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/moores-law-ends-as-computing-a-F5RUhjfwRJ.NJnSPMQPG1A</link>
      <description>For five decades, Moore's Law provided the semiconductor industry with a reassuring trajectory: the number of transistors on a chip roughly doubled every two years, delivering predictable performance gains. That era has now ended, according to experts, as the physical principles underpinning the trend have reached their limits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The computing industry is responding with a combination of overlapping strategies rather than a single breakthrough, relying on new materials, specialized processors, and experimental technologies to sustain progress.</description>

      <title>UN agency warns hundreds dead in Mediterranean shipwrecks</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/un-warns-hundreds-dead-in-medi-NaU0mNY0RK.RhgXbOjTsJQ</link>
      <description>The International Organization for Migration issued a grave warning on Monday that hundreds of migrants may be missing or dead following multiple shipwrecks in the Central Mediterranean over the past ten days, with vessels sent to sea during Cyclone Harry despite what the agency called "near-certain risk of death."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three fatalities have been confirmed in Lampedusa, Italy, including twin girls approximately one year old who died of hypothermia shortly before disembarkation, according to the IOM. A man also died from hypothermia on the same vessel, which departed from Sfax, Tunisia. The twins' mother, a Guinean national who survived the ordeal, recounted days of treacherous conditions at sea during the crossing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"While IOM is still seeking official confirmation, the scale of the reported fatalities points to yet another major tragedy in the Central Mediterranean," the agency said in a statement.</description>

      <title>Startup Genyro launches to speed DNA synthesis for AI-designed biology</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/scientists-use-ai-to-create-ne-f1E7AHUSR0OjG80WGBTUaw</link>
      <description>A tiny virus designed by artificial intelligence and assembled in a lab is reigniting debate over how quickly biology is becoming an engineering discipline—and how prepared regulators are for that shift.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The virus is a bacteriophage, meaning it infects bacteria rather than humans. It is part of a research effort in which Stanford University and Arc Institute scientists used genome language models—AI systems trained on DNA rather than text—to generate complete phage genomes and test them against Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the lab. The researchers reported 16 viable, AI-designed phages, with several showing **higher fitness and faster bacterial killing** than the natural phage template, ΦX174, in competition and lysis experiments.</description>

      <title>UN study links Iran's protest hotspots to water crisis zones</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/environmental-crisis-drives-ir-3nFIi39UQ927C7Qr76OIyg</link>
      <description>The anti-government protests convulsing Iran since late December are rooted not only in economic collapse and political repression but in a deeper, environmental catastrophe that has reached an inflection point. Dwindling water supplies, poisonous air, and crumbling infrastructure have compelled Iranians to take to the streets in the deadliest uprising the country has seen in decades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new analysis published this week by Nima Shokri of the United Nations University reveals a pattern: protests are more likely to erupt in areas suffering from groundwater depletion, land subsidence, and water rationing. Provinces such as Tehran, Khuzestan in the southwest, and Isfahan in central Iran, all regions with high levels of protest, are grappling with acute water shortages and disputes over access.</description>

      <description>Asian markets climbed on Tuesday as investors looked past President Donald Trump's warning of higher tariffs on South Korean goods, choosing instead to track Wall Street's gains and position for a pivotal week of tech earnings and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Kospi index rebounded sharply, rising over 2% and reclaiming the 5,000 level after earlier losses sparked by Trump's tariff announcement. The benchmark index had dipped in early trading before sentiment improved following comments from South Korea's presidential office indicating it had not been notified of any tariff plans in advance.</description>

      <title>New AI tool identifies genes across species without lab experiments</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/ai-tool-helixer-revolutionizes-m481JUNHQlilcyWb5OGeOA</link>
      <description>Researchers at Germany's Forschungszentrum Jülich and Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf have unveiled Helixer, an artificial intelligence tool that can identify genes directly from raw DNA sequences without requiring laboratory experiments or prior knowledge about the organism being studied. The results, published in Nature Methods, mark a major step forward in addressing a long-standing bottleneck in genome research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gene annotation—the process of locating genes within long strings of DNA letters—has long been one of the most challenging aspects of genome analysis. While genome sequencing was automated more than two decades ago, the interpretation of that data has lagged far behind. Helixer changes this by using deep learning combined with a hidden Markov model to detect typical features of genes, including start and stop signals and structural elements such as exons and introns.</description>

      <description>Researchers across Asia are leveraging artificial intelligence to transform how solid-state batteries are developed, with two major advances announced this week that could speed the transition from conventional lithium-ion technology to safer, more energy-dense alternatives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A review article published in the journal AI Agent by Tohoku University researchers outlines how AI agents are moving beyond isolated predictions to coordinate multi-step research strategies for discovering solid electrolytes, the materials that could replace flammable liquid electrolytes in next-generation batteries. Meanwhile, a team at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) has developed an AI framework that predicts cathode particle sizes with 86.6% accuracy while also indicating the reliability of its predictions.</description>

      <description>India and the European Union finalized a free trade agreement on Tuesday after nearly two decades of negotiations, creating a market of 2 billion people and representing approximately 25 percent of global economic output. The announcement came at the 16th India-EU Summit in New Delhi, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Yesterday a big agreement was signed between the European Union and India. People are calling this the mother of all deals," Modi said while inaugurating India Energy Week in Goa via video conferencing. The agreement covers about one-third of global trade and is expected to remove tariff and non-tariff barriers on more than 90 percent of goods traded between the two sides.</description>

      <description>Chinese aerospace scientists have developed an active flutter suppression system that enables flying wing aircraft to operate 62.5 percent faster than previously possible while retaining their stealth characteristics, according to peer-reviewed research published in December and announced by Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics last month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The breakthrough addresses a fundamental limitation that has constrained stealth bomber designs for decades: the trade-off between radar invisibility and speed. While flying wing aircraft like the U.S. B-2 Spirit excel at evading detection, their tailless design makes them vulnerable to dangerous vibrations at high speeds, forcing designers to limit them to subsonic flight.</description>

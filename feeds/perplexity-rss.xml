      <title>Half the world's major river deltas sink faster than seas rise</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/major-river-deltas-sink-faster-14a6flasQPmeB.aMrVS6.A</link>
      <description>Nearly half of the world's largest river deltas, including the Nile, Ganges, and Mekong, are sinking faster than global sea levels are rising, according to new research published Wednesday in Nature. The study warns that more than 236 million people face heightened flooding risk as human-caused land subsidence emerges as the dominant threat to these coastal regions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research, led by scientists at the University of California, Irvine and Virginia Tech, provides the first high-resolution, delta-wide assessment of elevation loss across 40 major river deltas spanning five continents. Using satellite radar data collected between 2014 and 2023, the team found that 18 of those deltas are experiencing average annual subsidence rates that exceed the current global sea-level rise rate of about 4 millimeters per year.</description>

      <title>Webb telescope's mysterious 'little red dots' are young black holes</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/scientists-identify-little-red-XeGg3Q7oT8uJJA3NY2pvPg</link>
      <description>Since the James Webb Space Telescope began operations in late 2021, one of its most perplexing discoveries has been hundreds of tiny, unexplained red points scattered throughout images of the early universe. Now, researchers from the University of Copenhagen have cracked the mystery: these "little red dots" are young supermassive black holes hidden within dense cocoons of ionized gas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings, published Wednesday in Nature, reveal that these enigmatic objects are far less massive than scientists initially believed—about 100 times smaller—yet still weigh up to 10 million times the mass of our Sun.</description>

      <description>SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service is now available for free in Iran, activists confirmed Wednesday, as France announced it is exploring sending Eutelsat terminals to the country to help citizens circumvent a communications blackout during the deadliest protests in the Islamic Republic in decades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dual initiatives represent an international effort to restore information flows as the death toll from Iran's brutal crackdown on demonstrators has surpassed 2,500, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), which reported at least 2,571 dead as of early Wednesday.</description>

      <description>Russia’s closest partners from Venezuela to Iran and Cuba are reassessing what Moscow’s backing is worth, after a series of crises in which Vladimir Putin’s government appeared either unable—or unwilling—to step in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The clearest warning sign has come in Venezuela, where the U.S. operation that captured President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3 has exposed gaps in the security ecosystem Caracas built with Russian and Cuban help—and showcased the limits of Russia’s power projection as it remains fixated on Ukraine.</description>

      <description>Astronomers are preparing for an unprecedented observational window when interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS aligns with the Sun-Earth axis on January 22, 2026, offering scientists what researchers describe as a once-in-decades opportunity to study pristine material from another star system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new research paper published this week by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb and Italian astronomer Mauro Barbieri of Italy's National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) details how the rare geometric alignment will enable measurements of the comet's dust composition that have never been possible with interstellar visitors.</description>

      <title>Denmark, US remain divided on Greenland after White House talks</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/denmark-and-us-remain-divided-4aDH.eqXQ.GjGOUZU6bq7g</link>
      <description>A "fundamental disagreement" persists between Denmark and the United States over Greenland's future, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said Wednesday after talks with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the White House. The meeting, which also included Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt, came as President Donald Trump doubled down on his insistence that America must control the Arctic territory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking after roughly an hour of discussions, Løkke Rasmussen told reporters that Trump has made clear his desire for the United States to acquire Greenland. "It is absolutely not necessary for the U.S. to seize Greenland," he said, urging Washington to engage in "respectful cooperation" over the island.</description>

      <title>Ocean climate engineering could threaten global food supply, study warns</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/study-finds-climate-engineerin-n7rnYfviSr6BeAXi48SjBg</link>
      <description>A major scientific review warns that proposed methods to combat climate change through ocean-based interventions could pose serious risks to marine ecosystems and global food supplies, even as commercial ventures push ahead with deploying these technologies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The review, published in Reviews of Geophysics, examines eight climate intervention strategies and concludes that while some approaches carry fewer risks than others, none is entirely safe for ocean life. The authors caution that without careful research, these interventions could disrupt the marine food chain that sustains more than a billion people worldwide.</description>

      <title>UK, France bolster Arctic presence as Trump presses Greenland demands</title>

      <description>British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper called on NATO on Wednesday to "step up its military and security presence in the Arctic," warning that the region is becoming "a front line of geopolitical competition" as climate change opens new shipping routes and exposes strategic resources. The appeal came as France announced it would open a consulate in Greenland next month, with both European allies taking concrete steps to counter U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated threats to take over the strategic Danish territory.</description>

      <title>Trump says Iran stopped killing protesters after his threats</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-says-iran-protester-kill-g6oyA_joQO6rYJYCGgj2aQ</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he has received assurances Iran has ceased killing protesters, suggesting his warnings of military action may have prompted the regime to back down amid one of the deadliest crackdowns in the country's modern history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We've been told that the killing in Iran is stopping — it's stopped," Trump told reporters during an Oval Office bill signing. "There's no plan for executions. I've been told that on good authority."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The announcement came just hours before Iran was expected to carry out the execution of Erfan Soltani, a 26-year-old shopkeeper from Fardis, west of Tehran, who was detained on January 8 and sentenced to death without access to a lawyer or trial, according to human rights groups and the U.S. State Department. Trump did not specify who provided the assurances, though Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had been in contact with Trump's top aide Steve Witkoff over the weekend.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump signed two executive orders Wednesday aimed at protecting domestic supply chains for semiconductors and critical minerals, invoking Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the national-security clause that allows presidents to impose tariffs on imports deemed threats to U.S. security.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a White House signing ceremony, Staff Secretary Will Scharf explained that the critical minerals order establishes "a mechanism, a process by which the United States will seek to secure its international supply chain of critical minerals and critical mineral derived products." The moves represent the culmination of investigations launched by the Department of Commerce in April 2025 into whether imports of these strategic materials threaten U.S. national security.</description>

      <description>US military intervention in Iran could occur within the next 24 hours, two European officials told Reuters on Wednesday, as President Donald Trump appears poised to authorize strikes amid protests that have killed more than 2,500 people in what French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot called "the most violent repression in Iran's contemporary history."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An Israeli official also told Reuters that Trump appears to have decided to intervene, though the scope and timing remain unclear. A Washington source close to the administration told The Independent that strikes could be imminent. "President Trump is ready to push the button on Iran," the source said. "It will be a surgical removal of the regime."</description>

      <description>Iran issued a NOTAM late on Wednesday night, shutting its airspace to all flights except international flights with special permission, as Western military officials warned that US military intervention could be imminent. The airspace closure, valid for just over two hours, sparked widespread flight diversions and cancellations across the Middle East amid escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FlightRadar24 announced on X that airspace over Iran began emptying rapidly before the notice was officially issued, with the flight-tracking platform noting: "New NOTAM just issued by Iran closing airspace to all flights except international flights to/from Iran with permission."</description>

      <description>Elon Musk's xAI announced Wednesday it has disabled Grok's ability to create sexualized images of real people, following weeks of global outcry over the chatbot generating nonconsensual deepfakes of women and children. The policy shift comes as the Pentagon simultaneously moves to integrate Grok into military networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis," X's safety team said in a statement. "This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers."</description>

      <description>Wildfires scorching the Arctic have reached levels unseen in 3,000 years, as rising temperatures transform the frozen north into an increasingly flammable landscape, according to a new NASA report and recent scientific studies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The number of wildland fires burning in the Arctic is on the rise, with blazes burning larger, hotter, and longer than in previous decades, researchers say. The burned area in the North American Arctic has roughly doubled compared to the mid-20th century, and the mid-2010s ushered in what scientists describe as a novel fire regime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Fire has always been a part of boreal and Arctic landscapes, but now it's starting to act in more extreme ways that mimic what we've seen in the temperate and the tropical areas," said Jessica McCarty, Deputy Earth Science Division Chief at NASA's Ames Research Center and lead author of a 2025 Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme report.</description>

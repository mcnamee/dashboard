      <title>China rejects Japan appeal to lift export controls</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/china-japan-tensions-rise-over-lKV9dK_TRd2AXHKEVI1kLQ</link>
      <description>Diplomatic and economic frictions between China and Japan intensified Friday as Beijing rejected Tokyo's appeals to lift export restrictions while Japanese officials confirmed widespread delays in agricultural shipments at Chinese customs, capping a week of mounting tensions between Asia's two largest economies.

Chinese Ambassador Wu Jianghao dismissed a Japanese Foreign Ministry petition Thursday to retract newly imposed export controls on dual-use items—products and technologies serving both civilian and military purposes—according to the Chinese embassy in Japan[1][2]. The restrictions, which China's Ministry of Commerce announced January 6 and implemented immediately, prohibit exports to Japan for military use or any purpose that could enhance Japanese military capabilities[3][4][5].

The measures came in direct response to comments by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who suggested in November that Japan could intervene militarily if China used force against self-governed Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory[3][1][6]. Wu called China's actions "entirely legitimate, reasonable and lawful" and vital to national security[1][2].</description>

      <description>Elon Musk's social media platform X limited its Grok AI image generation tool to paying subscribers only on Friday, following mounting international pressure over the chatbot's role in creating thousands of non-consensual sexualized images of women and children[1][2][3].

The restriction came after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer threatened to ban X entirely and called the imagery "disgraceful" and "disgusting"[1][4]. Downing Street condemned the paywall approach as "insulting" to victims, stating it "simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service"[2][5].</description>

      <title>Iran's Khamenei vows no retreat as crackdown kills 42</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/iran-supreme-leader-vows-no-ba-AAj2NnNmSauLbrpZKQS4kA</link>
      <description>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared Friday that the government will not back down against nationwide protests, accusing demonstrators of destroying public property to satisfy U.S. President Donald Trump as the regime tightened its crackdown on dissent[1][2][3][4][5].

"They are ruining their own streets to make the president of another country happy," Khamenei said in a televised address, dismissing Trump as having hands "stained with the blood of Iranians" while supporters chanted "Death to America"[1][2][3][6][5]. His defiant stance came as Iran's judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei separately warned that punishment for protesters "will be decisive, maximum and without any legal leniency"[1][7][5][8].

At least 42 people have been killed and more than 2,270 detained since demonstrations erupted December 28 over Iran's economic crisis, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency[1][9][3][10][5][11]. The death toll includes 29 protesters, eight security personnel, and five minors[11][12]. Rights groups warned the actual numbers could be higher due to a nationwide internet and phone blackout imposed Thursday[9][13][10][6].</description>

      <title>Pakistan nears $1.5B weapons deal with Sudan</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/pakistan-nears-1-5-billion-arm-yXTpA.MLTCCwEQVvyQrMPg</link>
      <description>Pakistan is in the final stages of a $1.5 billion weapons deal with Sudan, sources said Thursday, marking another major defense export for Islamabad as the cash-strapped nation seeks to leverage its growing arms industry. The agreement would supply jets, drones, and advanced air defense systems to Sudan's army as it battles paramilitary forces in a civil war that has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

The deal encompasses 10 Karakoram-8 light attack aircraft, more than 200 drones for reconnaissance and strike missions, and air defense systems, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity[1][2][3][4]. Aamir Masood, a retired Pakistani air marshal who continues to be briefed on air force matters, described the agreement as a "done deal"[1][2][3][4].

The weapons package may also include Super Mushshak training aircraft and possibly JF-17 fighters developed jointly with China, though Masood did not provide figures or a delivery schedule[1][2][4]. Pakistan's military and defense ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment, nor did a spokesman for Sudan's army[1][4].</description>

      <title>Trump cancels second Venezuela strikes after prisoner releases</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-cancels-second-wave-of-a-NzoHeKeNQqK1tWLtfp.XbA</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump announced Friday that he has canceled a previously expected second wave of military attacks against Venezuela, citing cooperation from the country's interim government including the release of political prisoners[1][2].

In a statement posted on his social media platform, Trump declared that "at least 100 Billion Dollars" would be invested by major oil companies in rebuilding Venezuela's oil and gas infrastructure, adding that he would meet with the executives at the White House later that day[1][2]. Despite the cancellation, Trump emphasized that "all ships will stay in place for safety and security purposes"[1][2].

The announcement came one day after Venezuela began releasing a significant number of political detainees, including prominent opposition figures Enrique Márquez, a former presidential candidate, and Biagio Pilieri, as well as security analyst Rocío San Miguel and five Spanish nationals[3][4][5]. The releases represent the first signs of cooperation since U.S. forces captured President Nicolás Maduro in a special operations raid on January 3[6][7][8].</description>

      <title>Black hole shreds star in brightest explosion ever seen</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/black-hole-shreds-star-in-reco-BQwRTb9uTfCzfR3iVBfy3g</link>
      <description>Astronomers have captured one of the most powerful cosmic explosions ever observed, an event that released energy equivalent to 400 billion suns as a black hole tore apart and devoured a massive star. The discovery, presented this week at the American Astronomical Society conference in Phoenix, provides unprecedented insight into how black holes feed and the extreme physics governing these violent encounters[1][2][3][4].

The event, officially designated AT2024wpp and nicknamed "the Whippet," was first detected on September 25, 2024, by the Zwicky Transient Facility at Palomar Observatory in California[5][6]. Located approximately 1.1 billion light-years from Earth, it represents the brightest example to date of a Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient, a rare class of cosmic explosion that scientists are still working to understand[2][7][5].

"We discovered what we think is a black hole merging with a massive companion star, shredding it into a disk that feeds the black hole," said Daniel Perley, the study's lead author from Liverpool John Moores University, at the conference[1][2][3]. "This was many times more energetic than any similar event and more than any known explosion powered by the collapse of a star."</description>

      <title>Greenland official wants talks with US without Denmark</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/greenland-floats-meeting-trump-j3Nef8qJQfOfXxcUS2IYpQ</link>
      <description>Greenland's foreign minister suggested that the Arctic territory should meet with the United States independently without Denmark present, signaling that American pressure tactics may be driving a wedge between Copenhagen and Nuuk as President Donald Trump continues to pursue his ambitions to acquire the island.

Vivian Motzfeldt told Danish broadcaster DR on Friday that Greenland should "take the lead" in discussions with Washington[1][2]. "When it comes to Greenland, it should be Greenland that takes the lead and speaks with the United States," she said[2]. "What would be wrong with us holding meetings with the United States on our own?"[1][2]

The comments come ahead of a scheduled meeting next week between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and officials from both Denmark and Greenland, marking the first significant three-way dialogue since Trump intensified his push to gain control of the territory[1][3][4]. While Motzfeldt acknowledged that the upcoming meeting would include Denmark and that Greenland still lacks authority over its own foreign policy, her remarks underscore growing tensions over how the semi-autonomous territory should navigate US pressure[1][2].</description>

      <description>Researchers in Switzerland and South Korea have announced separate breakthroughs this week that could accelerate the commercialization of all-solid-state lithium batteries, addressing two of the technology's most persistent challenges: dendrite formation and high manufacturing costs.

On January 7, the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland reported a new production process that combines gentle sintering with a thin protective coating to stabilize battery performance[1][2][3][4]. The approach achieved 75 percent capacity retention after 1,500 charge cycles, among the best results reported to date for solid-state systems[1][3]. Meanwhile, researchers at South Korea's KAIST announced a structural design breakthrough that boosted lithium ion mobility by two to four times using inexpensive materials, published in Nature Communications[5][6][7][8].</description>

      <title>NASA's Pandora satellite to launch Saturday, study exoplanet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/scientists-advance-search-for-gWiw5H.yTYaY9BG3rV630Q</link>
      <description>Astronomers are deploying new missions and refining detection methods as the hunt for extraterrestrial life enters what researchers describe as a transformative phase, with several breakthrough developments emerging this week.

NASA's Pandora satellite is scheduled to launch January 11 aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base, marking the first mission in the agency's Astrophysics Pioneers program dedicated specifically to studying exoplanet atmospheres[1][2]. The compact $20 million spacecraft will observe at least 20 known exoplanets during its one-year mission, searching for water vapor and other potential biosignatures by separating planetary signals from the interfering light of their host stars[1][2].

"Pandora's goal is to disentangle the atmospheric signals of planets and stars using visible and near-infrared light," said Elisa Quintana, Pandora's principal investigator at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center[2]. The mission will perform 10 observations of each target planet, with continuous 24-hour monitoring sessions designed to track how stellar surface features impact measurements[2].</description>

      <title>US, India clash over stalled trade deal</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/usindia-trade-deal-stalls-over-Zh3IIy_SRtmSM1EHOQzw8w</link>
      <description>A diplomatic rift has emerged between the United States and India over the reasons behind stalled trade negotiations, with Washington and New Delhi offering sharply different accounts of why a bilateral agreement remains elusive.

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick claimed Thursday that a trade deal collapsed because Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi failed to personally telephone President Donald Trump to finalize the agreement. Speaking on the All-In Podcast, Lutnick said India was given "three Fridays" to seal the deal but proved "uncomfortable" arranging the call[1][2][3][4]. "I said — You need to have Modi; it's all arranged. Modi must call the president. Yet, they were hesitant to do it," Lutnick said. "Consequently, Modi did not make the call"[1].

India swiftly rejected the characterization. Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters Friday that the two leaders spoke eight times during 2025 and that both nations have been "close to a deal" on multiple occasions[1][5][6]. "The characterization of these discussions in the reported remarks is not accurate," Jaiswal said, adding that India remains "interested in a mutually beneficial trade deal"[7][2][6].

The White House has not responded to Lutnick's comments[3][8].</description>

      <description>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates issued stark warnings about artificial intelligence and climate change in his annual letter released Friday, calling on governments to address risks he says market forces alone cannot solve.

Gates warned that "an even greater risk than a naturally caused pandemic is that a non-government group will use open source AI tools to design a bioterrorism weapon," drawing parallels to his prescient 2015 TED talk about pandemic unpreparedness[1][2][3][4]. The billionaire philanthropist also highlighted job market disruption as AI's second major challenge, noting that "we're already starting to see the impact of AI on the job market, and I think this impact will grow over the next five years"[3][4].

The letter, titled "Optimism with Footnotes," comes as President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on January 7[1][5][6]. Gates emphasized that "without a large global carbon tax—which is, unfortunately, politically unachievable—market forces do not properly incentivize the creation of technologies to reduce climate-related emissions"[2][7][8].</description>

      <title>Iran cuts internet access as economic protests spread</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/iran-shuts-down-internet-amid-wVdZ4PwfRXOxYPUN7KS1Sw</link>
      <description>Iran severed internet and telephone access nationwide on January 8 as mass protests demanding an end to the Islamic Republic entered their second week, with at least 42 people killed and more than 2,200 arrested since demonstrations erupted over the country's collapsing economy[1][2][3].

The internet blackout began around 8:30 p.m. local time Thursday, just as demonstrators responded to a call by exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi for coordinated nationwide protests[4][5][6]. NetBlocks, an internet monitoring organization, confirmed connectivity had plummeted to approximately 1% of ordinary levels by Friday, effectively isolating Iran's 71.9 million internet users from the outside world[1][7][8]. "Iran is now in the midst of a nationwide internet blackout," NetBlocks stated on social media platform X, adding that the shutdown "hinders the public's right to communicate at a critical moment"[8].

The demonstrations, which began in late December with merchants in Tehran protesting the rial's freefall to over 1.4 million per dollar, have since spread to all 31 provinces and evolved into broader calls for regime change[1][3][9]. The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported that 34 protesters and eight security personnel have died, with injuries largely caused by live ammunition, pellet shots, and plastic bullets[2][3][10].</description>

      <title>Khamenei vows no retreat amid deadly Iran protests</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/khamenei-vows-no-retreat-as-pr-k9EcMHfBQmeI68HCKAi1yQ</link>
      <description>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei delivered his first public remarks on nationwide protests Friday, vowing the Islamic Republic "will not back down" and accusing demonstrators of acting as "vandals" and "mercenaries for foreign powers." The defiant address came as Iran remained largely cut off from the world amid a nationwide internet and communications blackout imposed to suppress the unrest.

Speaking before supporters in Tehran on January 9, the 86-year-old cleric said protesters were destroying public property "to please" U.S. President Donald Trump, whose hands he claimed were "stained with the blood of thousands of Iranians" killed during last June's 12-day conflict between Israel, Iran, and the United States[1][2][3][4]. "The Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of hundreds of thousands of honorable people. It will not back down in the face of vandals," Khamenei declared[5][1][3].</description>

      <title>Trump vows U.S. will take Greenland 'whether they like it or not'</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-escalates-threats-to-tak-sTE3EQzPSeOpEHLq2xyPlA</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump dramatically escalated his campaign to acquire Greenland on Friday, telling reporters at the White House the United States will obtain the Danish territory "the easy way or the hard way"[1][2][3] and declaring "we are going to do something on Greenland whether they like it or not"[4][2][3].

The threats mark the most aggressive push yet by Trump to seize the Arctic island, following his stark assertion to The New York Times this week that his power as commander in chief is constrained only by his "own morality"[5][6][7]. "I don't need international law," Trump told the newspaper Wednesday, dismissing international legal frameworks even as he acknowledged his administration must follow such laws, adding "it depends what your definition of international law is"[5][7][8].

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the administration is "actively discussing" various strategies to acquire Greenland[9][10][11], explicitly stating that "utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander-in-chief's disposal"[12][13]. Reuters reported that officials are weighing payments of $10,000 to $100,000 to each of Greenland's approximately 57,000 residents to encourage secession from Denmark[14][9][15], potentially totaling up to $6 billion[9][15].</description>

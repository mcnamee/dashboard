      <title>Massive early galaxies took different paths, astronomers find</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/astronomers-uncover-early-univ-n5Oz8Og7QOCsbDo2Ei5O4Q</link>
      <description>Astronomers have discovered that the universe's most massive galaxies followed strikingly different evolutionary paths in their infancy, with some shutting down star formation early while others remained vigorously active but cloaked in dust.

The findings, presented today at the 247th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Phoenix, reveal that ultramassive galaxies containing more than 100 billion stars exhibited diverse behaviors less than 2 billion years after the Big Bang[1][2]. The research challenges assumptions that galaxy evolution proceeded uniformly in the early universe.

"What is striking is not just that we can detect hidden activity, but that we see such diversity among galaxies with similar masses at the same epoch," said Gillian Wilson, vice chancellor for research at UC Merced and professor of physics, who mentored the study[1]. "That tells us that the shutdown of star formation in the most massive galaxies was neither uniform nor simple."</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/intel-and-amd-launch-new-chips-99b3fWTUS.ab5hN3FlZrkA</link>
      <description>Intel and Advanced Micro Devices unveiled competing laptop processors at CES 2026 in Las Vegas on Monday, as both chipmakers push to capture market share in the AI-powered PC market with new technologies designed to boost performance and efficiency.

Intel officially launched its Panther Lake processors, branded as Intel Core Ultra Series 3, marking the first high-volume production chips built on the company's new 18A manufacturing process[1][2][3]. The stakes are high for Intel, which has struggled with yields and lost market share to AMD in recent years[1]. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the company delivered on its promise to ship products with 18A in 2025[1].

Intel claims the new chips deliver 60% better multithread performance than its previous Lunar Lake Series 2 processors[1][2]. The flagship feature is the new Arc B390 integrated graphics chip, which Intel says offers up to 77% faster gaming performance than Lunar Lake and can match Nvidia's discrete RTX 4050 mobile GPU[1][4]. Pre-orders for laptops with the new processors begin January 6, with systems shipping globally starting January 27[3][5].</description>

      <title>UN condemns US military operation in Venezuela</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/un-criticizes-us-intervention-wKZ3s8khTAm950ANwJy6ow</link>
      <description>The United Nations Human Rights Office issued a sharp rebuke Tuesday of the US military operation in Venezuela, warning that the intervention undermines international law and makes "all states less safe around the world."[1][2][3][4]

Speaking at a media briefing in Geneva, Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk, said the operation "violated a fundamental principle of international law" that prohibits states from using force against the territorial integrity or political independence of another state.[1][5][2] "It sends a signal that the powerful can do whatever they like," Shamdasani told reporters.[2][4][6]

The criticism follows the January 3 US military strike on Venezuela that resulted in the capture of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. More than 150 US aircraft bombed military installations across Caracas in the predawn operation, codenamed "Absolute Resolve," before special forces extracted Maduro from the Venezuelan capital.[7][8] Venezuelan officials reported at least 80 people were killed, including civilians.[8]</description>

      <title>One in five solar panels degrades twice as fast as expected, UNSW study finds</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/unsw-study-finds-20-percent-of-n5ni8eJ0T8uzqEg5PEng1Q</link>
      <description>Researchers at the University of New South Wales have uncovered a troubling pattern in solar panel performance, finding that approximately 20% of panels examined degrade much more rapidly than industry expectations, potentially lasting only half their anticipated 25-year lifespan.

The study, published in IEEE and released January 5, analyzed data from nearly 11,000 photovoltaic systems worldwide to investigate what scientists call the "long tail" problem—where a subset of panels fails far more quickly than the average degradation rate[1][2][3].

"Most solar systems are designed to last around 25 years, based on their warranty period," said Yang Tang, a PhD student at UNSW's School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering and co-author of the paper[1][3][4]. "For the entire dataset, we observed that system performance typically declines by around 0.9% per year. However, at least one in five systems degrade at least 1.5 times faster than this typical rate, and roughly one in 12 degrade twice as fast."

For operators of solar farms where hundreds of thousands of panels are installed, the findings represent a hidden financial risk that challenges the economic models underpinning the industry's growth[1][2][3].</description>

      <title>Japanese teams advance quantum computing with error correction breakthrough</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/japanese-teams-advance-quantum-tGtyiBrCRUOwSua_r_tj_g</link>
      <description>Japanese research teams are making parallel strides in quantum computing, with scientists at Institute of Science Tokyo achieving near-theoretical performance in error correction while RIKEN develops software to merge quantum computers with supercomputers.

A team led by Associate Professor Kenta Kasai at Institute of Science Tokyo has developed quantum error-correction codes that approach the theoretical limit known as the hashing bound, according to research published in npj Quantum Information[1][2][3][4]. The codes achieved a frame error rate as low as 10⁻⁴ for systems with hundreds of thousands of qubits, with decoding complexity that scales proportionally to the number of physical qubits—addressing a major barrier to practical quantum computing[1][2].

Traditional quantum error-correction methods hit an accuracy ceiling far below theoretical limits, requiring heavy computation that made large-scale systems impractical[1][2]. Kasai and Master's student Daiki Komoto constructed low-density parity-check codes defined over non-binary finite fields that handle both bit-flip and phase-flip errors simultaneously[3][5]. "Our quantum error-correcting code has a greater than 1/2 code rate, targeting hundreds of thousands of logical qubits," Kasai said[3][4]. The breakthrough could enable quantum computers to scale to millions of logical qubits, potentially advancing drug discovery, cryptography and climate prediction[1][6].</description>

The statements, made during a CNN interview, triggered sharp rebukes from European leaders who warned that such action would threaten the NATO alliance and upside decades of post-World War II security cooperation[3][4].

"Nobody is going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland," Miller said when pressed repeatedly about whether Washington would rule out military intervention[5][6]. He challenged Denmark's territorial claims, asking "by what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland?"[7][2]

The comments came days after a provocative social media post by Miller's wife, Katie Miller, who shared an image Saturday of Greenland covered in the American flag with the caption "SOON"[8][9]. The post followed closely on the heels of a U.S. military operation in Venezuela that captured President Nicolás Maduro, raising international concerns about the Trump administration's willingness to use force against sovereign nations.</description>

      <title>US pledges to back European force in Ukraine if Russia attacks</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/us-commits-to-back-ukraine-for-cDqmbWLwRhiCIk.BWqfbNQ</link>
      <description>The United States has pledged to support a European-led multinational force in Ukraine and lead ceasefire monitoring efforts under binding security commitments finalized at a Paris summit Tuesday, marking a significant shift in Western policy toward preventing future Russian aggression.

Draft statements from the gathering of the "Coalition of the Willing" indicate Washington will head a "continuous, reliable ceasefire monitoring system" with international participation following any peace agreement[1][2][3][4]. The US will also provide intelligence and logistics support to European forces deployed in Ukraine and commit to backing them "in case of attack" by Russia[1][2][3].

French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting representatives from 35 countries, including 27 heads of state, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, at the Élysée Palace[5][6][7]. The meeting aims to finalize contributions to security guarantees that Ukraine requires to deter further Russian aggression after nearly four years of war.</description>

      <title>Israel opens bidding for West Bank settlement to split territory</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/israel-approves-settlement-pro-TZ8E6gE0Ql6z3Id0og8rTA</link>
      <description>Israel has published a government tender seeking bids from developers to construct a settlement project near Jerusalem that would effectively divide the West Bank into northern and southern sections, marking the final step before construction begins on the long-frozen initiative.

The tender, posted on Israel's Land Authority website, calls for proposals to develop 3,401 housing units in the E1 area, an open tract of land east of Jerusalem[1][2][3]. The anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now first reported the tender. Yoni Mizrahi, who runs the group's settlement watch division, said initial work could begin within the month[1][2][4].

The move follows Israel's final approval of the E1 project in August 2025, when the Higher Planning Council validated plans after rejecting all objections[5][6]. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right politician who oversees settlement policy, has championed the project. "The Palestinian state is being erased from the table not with slogans but with actions," he said when Israel gave final approval to the plan in August[3][7]. "Every settlement, every neighborhood, every housing unit is another nail in the coffin of this dangerous idea."</description>

      <title>Iran offers $7 stipend amid protests over economic crisis</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/iran-offers-7-monthly-stipend-I22jl64aTAC8StrEWfYlRw</link>
      <description>Iran's government announced Monday it will distribute a monthly payment of approximately $7 to citizens in an attempt to quell nationwide protests that have left at least 35 people dead and sparked warnings from President Donald Trump.

Government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said the payments, worth one million tomans, would begin January 10 and aim to "preserve households' purchasing power, curb inflation, and ensure food security"[1][2]. The stipend represents a shift from $10 billion in annual import subsidies toward direct cash assistance, though the amount can buy only about 100 eggs, one kilogram of red meat, or several kilograms of rice at current prices[3][4].</description>

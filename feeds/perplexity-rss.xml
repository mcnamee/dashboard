      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/world-marks-international-holo-HN4jI9STRlyG_F1iOs9_Tw</link>
      <description>Candles flickered at dawn Tuesday at the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin as people across the globe paused to observe International Holocaust Remembrance Day, reflecting on Nazi Germany's murder of millions and its attempt to annihilate Jewish life in Europe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The annual commemoration falls on January 27, the anniversary of the 1945 liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau by Soviet forces. This year marks the 81st anniversary of that liberation, with the United Nations theme "Holocaust Remembrance for Dignity and Human Rights" guiding observances worldwide.</description>

      <title>Milano Cortina 2026 Olympics races to make snow as winters warm</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/climate-change-challenges-snow-YGriUhkkTTKeYBkv7eiU1w</link>
      <description>Snowmaking crews at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics are racing against time to prepare competition surfaces as climate change continues to shrink the windows of freezing temperatures needed to produce artificial snow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the opening ceremony scheduled for February 6 in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, organizers have relied heavily on snowmaking infrastructure to supplement increasingly unpredictable natural snowfall in Italy's Alpine venues. Recent snowfall over the past weekend has provided relief, but the long-term trend is clear: winters are warming, and the margin for error is narrowing.</description>

      <description>The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists advanced the Doomsday Clock to 85 seconds before midnight on Tuesday, marking the closest the symbolic timepiece has ever been to catastrophe. The four-second move from 89 seconds, set in January 2025, reflects what scientists say are intensifying nuclear threats, accelerating climate change, and the growing risks posed by artificial intelligence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Doomsday Clock's message cannot be clearer," Alexandra Bell, president and CEO of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, said at the announcement. "Catastrophic destruction, primarily due to nuclear risks and other global threats," is becoming increasingly probable, according to the organization.</description>

      <title>Carney rejects US claim he walked back criticism of Trump trade policy</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/carney-rejects-us-claim-he-wal-kBH2vEmBSFio_SBZmVtKpg</link>
      <description>Prime Minister Mark Carney told President Donald Trump that Canada stands by its trade diversification strategy and recent deal with China during a phone call Monday, pushing back against claims from the Trump administration that he had backed down from his earlier criticism of American trade policy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I meant what I said in Davos," Carney told reporters Tuesday before a cabinet meeting in Ottawa. "Canada was the first country to understand the change in U.S. trade policy that he had initiated, and we're responding to that."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The call comes amid escalating tensions between Washington and Ottawa as the two countries prepare for a formal review of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement later this year. Trump had threatened over the weekend to impose 100% tariffs on Canadian goods if Canada proceeds with a trade agreement with China, posting on Truth Social that Prime Minister Carney was "gravely mistaken" if he thought Canada could become a "Drop Off Port" for Chinese products.</description>

      <title>Lunai Bioworks launches AI tool to block chemical weapon design</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/lunai-bioworks-launches-sentin-AKQL3AHbQ86nRzLFhVT0kQ</link>
      <description>Lunai Bioworks on Tuesday announced the deployment of Sentinel, a transformer-based AI safeguard designed to prevent large language models and scientific AI systems from generating novel chemical agents. The Sacramento-based biotech company said the technology embeds directly within foundation models to screen molecular outputs in real time, functioning as what CEO David Weinstein described as "the immune system for scientific AI."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"As AI models become more powerful, safety has to move closer to the core," Weinstein said in a statement. "Sentinel operates inside AI systems—not outside them—stopping dangerous chemical designs before they are ever produced."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The launch comes amid mounting concern over the dual-use risks of advanced AI in chemistry and biology, with major AI companies including Anthropic and OpenAI warning that powerful models could assist bad actors in developing biological and chemical threats.</description>

      <title>Study finds narrow ocean bands absorb 72% of seas' carbon</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/ocean-fronts-absorb-72-percent-42IyYWCIRMG2gh_C4xsxkg</link>
      <description>Narrow bands of ocean covering just over one-third of the world's seas are responsible for absorbing nearly three-quarters of the carbon dioxide that oceans pull from the atmosphere, according to new research that reshapes scientific understanding of Earth's carbon cycle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study, published in Nature Climate Change, reveals that ocean fronts—turbulent boundaries where different water masses collide—cover 36 percent of the global ocean but account for 72 percent of total oceanic carbon dioxide uptake, absorbing approximately 1.8 billion tons of carbon annually.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"This is the first time we've been able to quantify the disproportionate role that ocean fronts play in absorbing atmospheric CO2 on a global scale, and it has major implications for climate modelling," said lead author Dr. Kai Yang, who completed the research during his PhD at the University of Tasmania's Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) and is now a postdoctoral researcher at Xiamen University in China.</description>

      <title>Tesla brand value drops 36% as Musk's politics erode trust</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/tesla-faces-third-year-of-decl-1msXq1sYRrmItVOaSmonVQ</link>
      <description>Tesla faces a crossroads this week as its brand value hits a three-year low and Wall Street braces for another year of declining profitability. The electric vehicle maker is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2025 earnings on Wednesday, January 28, amid mounting evidence that CEO Elon Musk's political activities and the company's aging vehicle lineup are weighing heavily on business performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Brand Finance, Tesla's brand value fell by $15.4 billion, or 36%, in 2025, marking its third consecutive annual decline. The London-based research firm now values the Tesla brand at $27.61 billion, down from $43 billion at the start of 2025 and well below its peak of $66.2 billion in January 2023.</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/nasa-and-scientists-reveal-new-HxZN.EY1SMi69pzpf8BglA</link>
      <description>Jupiter's moon Europa remains one of the most tantalizing targets in the search for extraterrestrial life, but two recent studies paint a complex and sometimes contradictory picture of whether its vast subsurface ocean could actually support living organisms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NASA announced on Sunday that data from the Juno spacecraft has provided the first direct measurement of Europa's ice shell thickness, determining it averages about 18 miles (29 kilometers) in the region observed during a 2022 flyby. The findings, published in Nature Astronomy in December, represent a landmark measurement that settles a long-standing scientific debate over whether the shell is thin or thick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The 18-mile estimate relates to the cold, rigid, conductive outer-layer of a pure water ice shell," said Steve Levin, Juno project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "If an inner, slightly warmer convective layer also exists, which is possible, the total ice shell thickness would be even greater."</description>

      <description>Colombian President Gustavo Petro said Tuesday that ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro should be returned to face trial in his home country rather than in the United States, adding a new layer of complexity to regional tensions one week before his scheduled meeting with President Donald Trump.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"They have to return him and have him tried by a Venezuelan court, not a US one," Petro said Tuesday, according to Bloomberg. The statement marks the Colombian leader's most direct intervention yet in the diplomatic standoff over Maduro's fate since US forces captured the former Venezuelan president in a dramatic pre-dawn raid on January 3.</description>

      <description>Nearly four years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the combined military toll of the conflict is approaching two million casualties, according to a study released Tuesday by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Washington-based think tank estimates approximately 1.2 million Russian troops and close to 600,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed, wounded, or gone missing since February 2022, bringing the current total to roughly 1.8 million. By this spring, the study projects, that figure will reach two million if current trends continue.</description>

      <description>Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Tuesday that the Trump administration is prepared to use military force to ensure Venezuela's acting President Delcy Rodríguez complies with American demands, escalating tensions nearly a month after US special forces captured Nicolás Maduro in a dramatic predawn raid on Caracas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The warning came as Colombia's President Gustavo Petro called for Maduro to be returned to Venezuela to face trial in his home country rather than in the United States. "They have to return him and have him tried by a Venezuelan court, not a US one," Petro said Tuesday, one week before a scheduled February 3 meeting with Trump at the White House.</description>

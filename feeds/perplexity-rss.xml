      <title>Musk proposes turning rural Spain, Sicily into solar hubs for Europe</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/musk-proposes-solar-power-plan-s8JH_MiHQfe_IPUhwZ2VUw</link>
      <description>At his first-ever appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Elon Musk proposed that sparsely populated regions of Spain and Sicily could be transformed into large-scale solar power hubs capable of generating electricity for the entire European continent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking Thursday in a conversation with Larry Fink, the chairman and CEO of BlackRock, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX argued that the technology for such ambitious projects already exists—what remains is the political will and investment to deploy it.</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/ai-job-fears-and-rivalries-dom-6ThU2TPRSCijRIefO.ugfg</link>
      <description>As the World Economic Forum wrapped up in Davos this week, artificial intelligence's impact on jobs and a sharpening rivalry among leading AI companies emerged as the defining themes of the annual gathering of global elites.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's warnings of potential "civil unrest" to IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva describing AI's labor market impact as a "tsunami," the summit featured rare agreement among business leaders that workforce disruption is accelerating faster than society can adapt.</description>

      <title>Greenland has no rare earth mines despite major reserves, report finds</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/greenland-faces-climate-and-mi-jNuX2kUkRw.mCAG0uAKiFw</link>
      <description>As the world's largest island draws unprecedented geopolitical attention, Greenland's critical role in climate science and its vast but largely inaccessible mineral wealth face mounting challenges from logistical barriers, strict environmental regulations, and an uncertain political future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ice sheet covering roughly 80 percent of the island lost 105 billion metric tons of ice in the year ending August 2025, marking the 29th consecutive year of net ice loss, according to researchers from the Danish Meteorological Institute. Scientists warn that if Greenland's massive ice sheet were to fully melt, global sea levels could rise by approximately seven meters.</description>

      <description>Gold surged to within striking distance of $5,000 per troy ounce on Friday, reaching an intraday record of $4,970 in Asian trading, as markets responded to a whirlwind week of geopolitical developments including President Donald Trump's surprise reversal on tariff threats tied to Greenland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The precious metal has climbed roughly 11% in the first weeks of January alone, extending a historic 64% rally in 2025, as investors seek refuge from policy uncertainty and tensions continue across multiple global flashpoints.</description>

      <title>Nvidia shares rise on reports China approved H200 chip orders</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/nvidia-gains-on-china-chip-app-NdY1H1yXTn2CIjHA4a9q8Q</link>
      <description>Shares of Nvidia rose in early trading Friday after Chinese regulators granted in-principle approval for the country's largest technology companies to begin preparing orders for the chipmaker's H200 artificial intelligence processors, a move suggesting Beijing is close to formally authorizing imports of the components critical to powering AI systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bloomberg reported that regulators have cleared Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance to move to the next stage of purchasing preparations, including negotiating specifics such as the quantities they would require. The development represents a meaningful shift in China's stance after weeks of uncertainty following a de facto import ban earlier in January.</description>

      <title>Climate talks take back seat at Davos as AI, geopolitics dominate</title>

      <description>As global leaders gathered in Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum's 56th Annual Meeting this week, climate change discussions that once dominated the gathering took a back seat to geopolitics, artificial intelligence, and economic competition. The shift reflects a broader recalibration among business and political leaders who increasingly prioritize adaptation over ambitious emissions reduction goals.</description>

      <description>Goldman Sachs upgraded its end-2026 gold price target to $5,400 per ounce from $4,900, a more than 10% increase, as the investment bank said private investors hedging global policy risks and emerging-market central banks diversifying reserves are reshaping demand dynamics for the precious metal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The revision, contained in a research note dated January 21 by analysts Daan Struyven and Lina Thomas, positions gold for roughly 9% further upside from prices trading near $4,950 per ounce on Friday morning as the metal flirts with the $5,000 milestone.</description>

      <title>Trump claim that NATO allies avoided Afghan frontlines sparks fury</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-sparks-backlash-claiming-YK19G4JTQBqRX.bNmReHgg</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump ignited fury across NATO allies on Thursday after claiming in a Fox News interview that troops from allied nations "stayed a little back, a little off the front lines" during the war in Afghanistan. The remarks drew immediate condemnation from British, Polish, Danish, and Canadian officials, as well as veterans who served in the conflict, prompting British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to call the comments "insulting and frankly appalling."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump questioned whether NATO would support the United States if called upon. "We've never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them," Trump said. "They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, and they did—they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines."</description>

      <title>Davos forum ends with climate sidelined as U.S. pushes fossil fuels</title>

      <description>As the World Economic Forum wrapped up its 56th Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on January 23, the gathering revealed a stark realignment: climate change discussions had retreated to the sidelines, while fossil fuels took center stage amid a fractured geopolitical landscape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump's address on January 21 set the tone. "There are windmills all over Europe, and they are failures," Trump told the audience of global executives and policymakers, branding green initiatives "the Green New Scam." He promoted oil and nuclear power, claiming U.S. natural gas production had reached record highs and oil output had risen by 730,000 barrels per day.</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-says-us-armada-heading-t-qmpMLFOFT3eVcIARmuDjAQ</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump announced Thursday that a US military "armada" is heading toward Iran, even as he expressed hope that the deployment would not be needed for further military action against Tehran.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We have an armada. We have a massive fleet heading in that direction, and maybe we won't have to use it. We'll see," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The deployment includes the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, several guided-missile destroyers, and fighter aircraft, which began moving from the Asia-Pacific region last week, according to US officials speaking to Reuters. The carrier strike group is expected to arrive in the Middle East in the coming days, with officials also considering additional air defense systems to protect US forces and bases in the region.</description>

      <description>Business leaders at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, projected optimism this week about artificial intelligence creating jobs despite stark warnings from global economic officials and rising worker anxiety about the technology's disruptive potential.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang emerged as a leading voice for AI optimism, telling attendees that the technology would generate employment across blue-collar trades. "Energy is creating jobs. Chips industry is creating jobs. The infrastructure layer is creating jobs," Huang said during a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. "Jobs, jobs, jobs."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Huang characterized the current AI buildout as "the largest infrastructure buildout in human history," predicting six-figure salaries for electricians, plumbers, and construction workers without needing "a Ph.D. in computer science."</description>

The Ukrainian leader noted his negotiating team had provided updates "almost every hour" throughout the day but offered no details about specific discussions or progress.</description>

      <description>Uganda's military chief announced Friday that authorities have detained 2,000 opposition supporters and killed 30 people in an escalating crackdown following last week's contested presidential election in which his father, President Yoweri Museveni, won a seventh term.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who is also Museveni's son and widely believed to be his designated successor, disclosed the figures in a series of overnight social media posts, labeling members of the opposition National Unity Platform as "hooligans and terrorists." "So far we have killed 30 NUP terrorists," Kainerugaba wrote on X, without explaining the circumstances of the deaths. "Most NUP terrorist leaders are in hiding. We shall get them all," he added in another post.</description>

      <description>KLM, Air France, Lufthansa, British Airways, Swiss, and several other major carriers abruptly suspended flights to Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia on Friday, citing escalating security concerns as U.S. President Donald Trump announced a naval "armada" heading toward Iran.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The coordinated cancellations, which began late Thursday evening and extended through the weekend, disrupted travel plans for thousands of passengers across Europe and left airports scrambling to manage the sudden disruption. The flight suspensions came as Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan warned that Israel continues to seek an opportunity to strike Iran.</description>

      <description>Gold approached $5,000 per ounce on Friday, capping its strongest week since March 2020, while silver breached the $100 threshold for the first time and Intel shares tumbled more than 17%, dragging down U.S. markets to a muted close.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The precious metals surge came amid lingering geopolitical uncertainty, a weakening U.S. dollar, and investor demand for safe-haven assets. Meanwhile, Wall Street concluded a volatile week with all three major indexes posting losses, as the chipmaker's disappointing outlook underscored persistent challenges in the semiconductor industry.</description>

She did not provide a specific timeline for when these releases occurred.</description>

      <title>Studies find AI language models mirror human brain in both processing and bias</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/ai-language-models-mirror-huma-1E1tmu96QiSis0JKd0K52A</link>
      <description>Two new studies reveal that the systems powering AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini share unexpected parallels with the human brain—not just in how they build meaning from words, but also in how they absorb social biases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Research published in Nature Communications found that the human brain processes spoken language through a stepwise sequence that closely mirrors the layered architecture of large language models (LLMs). A separate study from the University of Vermont, posted to the arXiv preprint server, shows that widely used AI models exhibit "us vs. them" social biases similar to patterns documented in human psychology.</description>

      <description>Iran declared Friday that any military attack on its territory will be treated as "all-out war," issuing its starkest warning yet as a US aircraft carrier strike group steams toward the Middle East amid heightened tensions over the country's deadly crackdown on nationwide protests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Any attack, limited or otherwise, will be treated as an all-out war against us, and we will respond in the hardest way possible," a senior Iranian official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. The warning came as Iranian forces remained on high alert ahead of the arrival of US military reinforcements in the region.</description>

      <description>The Pentagon on Friday unveiled its National Defense Strategy, outlining a fundamental change in how the United States approaches security on the Korean Peninsula: South Korea will now be expected to take the lead in deterring North Korea, with Washington providing "more limited" support.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"South Korea is capable of taking primary responsibility for deterring North Korea with critical but more limited U.S. support," according to the document released Friday evening, as reported by Reuters. "This shift in the balance of responsibility is consistent with America's interest in updating U.S. force posture on the Korean Peninsula."</description>

      <description>An international consortium of scientists has proposed a spacecraft mission to generate artificial solar eclipses in space, offering unprecedented views of the Sun's atmosphere as Earth experiences its most severe solar radiation storm in over two decades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Moon-Enabled Sun Occultation Mission, known as Mesom, has been submitted to the European Space Agency for consideration as a future mission. If approved, the mini-satellite would position itself within the Moon's shadow roughly once every 29.6 days, creating total eclipse conditions lasting up to 48 minutes—ten times longer than typical eclipses observed from Earth.</description>

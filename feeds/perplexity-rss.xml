      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/european-security-advisers-bac-ufWbNoP_TeKw4buFbzId6w</link>
      <description>National security advisers from across Europe convened in Kyiv on Saturday to advance a US-led peace proposal and coordinate international support for Ukraine, marking a pivotal moment in diplomatic efforts to end Russia's nearly four-year war.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the talks achieved progress on three fronts: security guarantees, reconstruction, and "a basic framework for a real rebuilding."[1] Representatives from Canada, NATO, and over a dozen European nations participated in the high-level discussions, which Ukraine's chief negotiator Rustem Umerov described as focusing on "security and economic issues, work on framework documents, and coordination of further steps with partners."[2][3]</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/us-capture-of-maduro-draws-int-z4ZXJLnGTLKLIwO34uWrPw</link>
      <description>World leaders expressed deep concern and sharp divisions over the US military operation in Venezuela on Saturday, with the United Nations and major powers condemning the strikes as a dangerous violation of international law while some regional allies celebrated the capture of President Nicolás Maduro.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he was "deeply alarmed" by the overnight operation, warning that "these developments constitute a dangerous precedent," according to his spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric[1][2]. Guterres emphasized "the importance of full respect—by all—of international law, including the UN Charter" and expressed concern that "the rules of international law have not been respected"[1][3]. Venezuela has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council[1][2].</description>

      <title>US seizes Maduro in strike, threatening Canada's oil dominance</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/us-captures-maduro-impacting-c-hNC3Ztn.Rlu7q1qLt1UeQg</link>
      <description>In the predawn hours of Saturday, US special forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a military strike on Caracas, a dramatic escalation that could eventually reshape North American oil markets and erode Canada's dominant position as America's top crude supplier.

President Donald Trump announced at a Mar-a-Lago press conference that Maduro and his wife were seized by Delta Force operators and flown out of Venezuela to face narco-terrorism charges in New York[1][2]. The operation, dubbed "Absolute Resolve," involved 150 aircraft and lasted approximately two hours[3].</description>

      <title>Trump defends skipping Congress briefing on Venezuela raid</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-defends-not-notifying-co-AMDy0REjR7.rDCDdZeFFOw</link>
      <description>President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended their decision to bypass congressional notification before an overnight military operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Saturday, arguing that advance warning could have jeopardized the mission due to potential leaks from Capitol Hill.

"Congress has a tendency to leak," Trump said during a Saturday press conference at Mar-a-Lago[1][2][3]. "This would not be good. If they leaked...I think maybe it would have been a very different result."

The administration's decision not to brief the so-called "Gang of Eight"—the top congressional leaders and chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate intelligence committees—before the operation has sparked sharp criticism from Democrats and some Republicans who argue it violated the War Powers Act[4][5][6]. The 1973 law requires the president to consult with Congress "in every possible instance" before introducing forces into hostilities or situations where imminent hostilities are likely[3].</description>

      <description>The United Nations Security Council will convene an emergency session Monday morning to address the U.S. military operation in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro, following widespread international condemnation and warnings that the strikes set a "dangerous precedent" for global order[1][2][3].

UN Secretary-General António Guterres expressed deep alarm at the overnight events, stating through his spokesperson that "these developments constitute a dangerous precedent" and that he remains "deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected"[1][4][5]. The 15-member Security Council meeting, scheduled for 10 a.m. Monday, was requested by Venezuela and Colombia with support from Russia and China[6][2][3].</description>

      <title>Caracas residents hunker down after US captures Maduro</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/venezuelans-in-caracas-hunker-yiTUfx0NS_yTQwCa2VnYdQ</link>
      <description>Hours after US forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in an overnight military strike, the streets of Caracas remained largely deserted Saturday as residents grappled with an uncertain future and Venezuelan officials demanded proof their leader was still alive.

The capital awoke to desolate streets patrolled by security forces following explosions that began around 2 a.m. local time[1][2]. Parts of southern Caracas remained without electricity after strikes targeted the Fuerte Tiuna military base and La Carlota airbase[2][3], while smoke continued billowing from the Port of La Guaira to the north[1][4]. Downtown Caracas smelled of gunpowder, according to CNN reporters[5].

President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, had been "captured and flown out of the country" following what he called a "large-scale strike"[6][7]. The operation, which Trump said was conducted with US law enforcement, marked the first such American military intervention in Latin America since the 1989 Panama invasion that ousted Manuel Noriega[1][3].</description>

      <title>UK and France strike ISIS weapons site in Syria</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/uk-and-france-conduct-joint-ai-DRDRGr.IQM.dWTUJWkMI7g</link>
      <description>British and French air forces launched a coordinated strike Saturday evening on a suspected ISIS weapons facility in the mountains north of Palmyra, Syria, marking the latest Western operation to prevent the terror group's resurgence in the region[1][2][3][4][5].

RAF Typhoon FGR4 jets, supported by a Voyager refueling tanker, joined French aircraft in targeting multiple access tunnels leading to an underground site believed to store weapons and explosives[1][3][6][7]. The operation used Paveway IV guided bombs, with initial assessments indicating successful engagement of the target[1][2][8][7]. Britain's Ministry of Defence confirmed all aircraft returned safely and that the remote location was devoid of civilian habitation[1][3][8][7][9].

"This action shows our UK leadership, and determination to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies, to stamp out any resurgence of Daesh and their dangerous and violent ideologies in the Middle East," British Defence Secretary John Healey said, using an alternative name for ISIS[1][4][5][9].</description>

      <description>Venezuelans across the globe erupted in jubilation Saturday after US forces captured President Nicolás Maduro in a predawn military operation, ending his authoritarian rule that prompted one of the world's largest migration crises in recent history.

In the early hours of January 3, the United States launched "Operation Absolute Resolve," a massive strike involving more than 150 aircraft that disabled Venezuela's air defenses and extracted Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, from the presidential compound in Caracas[1][2]. President Donald Trump announced at a Mar-a-Lago press conference that Maduro had been "captured and flown out of the country" and would face drug trafficking charges in New York[1][3].</description>

      <title>Venezuelan VP rejects Trump claim, demands Maduro release</title>

      <description>Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez publicly rejected President Trump's assertion that she had assumed power as interim president following the U.S. capture of Nicolás Maduro, instead demanding the authoritarian leader's release in a televised address that underscored the immediate obstacles facing Washington's efforts to govern the South American nation[1][2][3].

In a Saturday morning press conference at Mar-a-Lago, Trump claimed that Rodríguez "was just sworn in as president" and had told Secretary of State Marco Rubio she was "essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again"[4][5]. Within hours, however, Rodríguez appeared on Venezuelan state television flanked by the country's National Defense Council—including the defense minister, attorney general, and legislative and judicial leaders—to denounce the U.S. military operation as "an aggression, a military aggression unprecedented against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela"[6][7].</description>

      <description>At least 40 people, including civilians and soldiers, were killed in the U.S. military strikes on Venezuela early Saturday that resulted in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro, according to a senior Venezuelan official cited by The New York Times[1]. Official casualty figures remain pending as Venezuelan authorities continue to assess the toll from the two-hour operation dubbed "Absolute Resolve."

Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez confirmed deaths among both civilians and military personnel without providing specific numbers[2][3][4]. "Innocent victims have been mortally wounded and others killed by this criminal terrorist attack," Attorney General Tarek William Saab said in a televised statement[5][6].</description>

      <title>Venezuela oil exports halt amid U.S. blockade, Maduro capture</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/venezuela-halts-oil-exports-am-U0AvODpQRey9p54ll5evCw</link>
      <description>Venezuela's oil exports have come to a near standstill as tankers avoid the South American nation amid an escalating U.S. naval blockade and the dramatic capture of President Nicolás Maduro on Saturday. The paralysis threatens to further cripple the economy of a country sitting atop the world's largest proven oil reserves.

Following weeks of mounting pressure, including vessel seizures and sanctions, oil shipments from Venezuela have effectively ceased, with only tankers chartered by Chevron continuing operations under special U.S. authorization. More than 11 million barrels of crude remain stranded on vessels in Venezuelan waters, while the country's storage facilities have filled to capacity, forcing state oil company PDVSA to shut in wells across its main production region[1][2][3].</description>

      <title>Venezuela court orders VP Rodriguez to assume presidential powers</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/venezuela-grants-vp-rodriguez-h4od9PW7R1CgPO04fUJffw</link>
      <description>Venezuela's Supreme Court ordered Vice President Delcy Rodriguez to immediately assume all presidential powers in an acting capacity on Saturday, establishing legal continuity for the government one day after U.S. forces captured President Nicolás Maduro in a dramatic overnight raid[1][2][3].

The Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice issued the order on January 3, directing Rodriguez to take charge of the presidency to guarantee "administrative continuity" and the "defense of the nation" following what the court described as Maduro's forced absence[1]. Rodriguez, 56, stepped into the role Saturday afternoon, hours after the U.S. military operation[2][3].

Under Venezuela's constitution, the executive vice president assumes presidential duties when the president becomes temporarily or permanently unavailable to serve[2][3][4]. Articles 233 and 234 outline the succession process, making Rodriguez's assumption of power the legally prescribed course of action[2][3].</description>

      <description>National security advisers from approximately 18 countries convened in Kyiv on Saturday to advance a U.S.-led peace framework for Ukraine, including an $800 billion economic support package designed to sustain the country's recovery and growth over the next decade[1][2][3][4].

The high-level talks, which brought together representatives from Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Poland, and other European nations, as well as NATO and European Union officials, mark a critical step in efforts to end the nearly four-year war[2][5]. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said all documents under discussion, including those on security guarantees, had been shared with the advisers, allowing work to accelerate[3][4].</description>

      <title>No alien signals found from 3I/ATLAS interstellar object</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/3iatlas-shows-no-alien-signals-NWipmojZQVSoH6aGU.P.TQ</link>
      <description>The world's most sensitive radio telescope has found no evidence of artificial signals from 3I/ATLAS, the largest interstellar object ever detected, according to results published this week by the Breakthrough Listen program[1][2][3]. Yet the mysterious visitor continues to captivate astronomers with unusual features that challenge conventional understanding of comets.

On December 18, one day before the object's closest approach to Earth, the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia scanned 3I/ATLAS across radio frequencies from 1 to 12 gigahertz[3][4][5]. The search, conducted by a team led by astronomer Ben Jacobson-Bell of the University of California, Berkeley, initially flagged 471,198 potential signals[4][6]. After filtering out interference, nine candidates remained—all of which were traced to human-made radio noise on Earth[2][4].

"No artificial radio emission localized to 3I/ATLAS was detected," the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute confirmed[1][2][7]. The telescope was sensitive enough to detect transmitters as weak as 100 milliwatts, roughly the power of a mobile phone[8][3].</description>

      <title>Rubio says oil embargo to remain after Maduro capture</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/us-military-operation-captures-x70cOzE7SZeBvcvezHVtlg</link>
      <description>Elite US special forces seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife early Saturday morning in a dramatic operation that has drawn international condemnation and raised questions about Venezuela's political future. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that an oil "quarantine" will remain the primary tool to pressure the country's new leadership.

The operation, codenamed "Operation Absolute Resolve," began around 2:01 a.m. local time Saturday when Delta Force commandos raided Maduro's heavily fortified compound in Caracas[1][2][3]. More than 150 aircraft from 20 bases supported the mission, which transported Maduro to New York where he faces drug trafficking charges dating to 2020[2][4][5].

At least 40 people were killed in the strikes, including civilians and military personnel, according to a Venezuelan official who spoke to The New York Times[6][7]. President Trump said several US service members were injured but none were killed[8][6].</description>

      <title>Iran protests enter second week with 16 dead, 580 arrested</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/iran-protests-escalate-over-so-XBd6Fap1SAuYXld9vHJF6g</link>
      <description>Nationwide demonstrations over Iran's economic crisis intensified into their second week, with at least 16 people killed and more than 580 arrests reported across the country, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency[1][2]. The protests, which began December 28 among bazaar merchants in Tehran, have spread to over 170 locations across 25 of Iran's 31 provinces as of January 4[1][3].

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei addressed the unrest Saturday, calling protesters' economic concerns "valid" while warning that "rioters must be put in their place"[4][5]. His remarks followed President Trump's Friday statement on Truth Social pledging U.S. support if Iran "violently kills peaceful protesters," declaring Washington was "locked and loaded and ready to go"[6][7]. Iranian officials immediately warned against any U.S. interference, with a senior advisor to Khamenei stating that "the hand that comes to Iran's interior under any pretext will be cut off before it can act"[7].</description>

      <title>Iran, Russia, China condemn US capture of Maduro</title>

      <description>Iran, Russia, China, and a coalition of Latin American nations issued sharp rebukes of the US military operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Saturday, fracturing the international community over questions of sovereignty and legal authority. The coordinated denunciations highlighted deep divisions over President Donald Trump's intervention, with even traditional American allies expressing alarm about violations of international law.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi condemned the operation as "a clear instance of state terrorism" during a phone call with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil Pinto on Saturday[1][2][3][4]. Iran's Foreign Ministry called the action "a flagrant violation" of Venezuela's sovereignty and territorial integrity, urging the United Nations to take immediate action[5][6][7]. The statement emphasized that the US military aggression breached fundamental principles of the UN Charter, particularly Article 2(4) which prohibits the use of force[8][5].</description>

      <title>China demands US free Maduro after Venezuela raid</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/china-demands-immediate-releas-_tMucwgRSNiddfMTGajWJg</link>
      <description>China has called on the United States to immediately release Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, following a dramatic US military operation that captured and removed them from Venezuela in the early hours of January 3. Beijing condemned the action as a clear violation of international law and urged Washington to stop efforts to topple the Venezuelan government[1][2][3][4].

"China expresses grave concern over the U.S. forcibly seizing President Nicolás Maduro and his wife and taking them out of the country," the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted Sunday on its website[5][6][7]. "The U.S.'s move is in clear violation of international law, basic norms in international relations, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter."

This marks Beijing's second statement since Saturday, when President Donald Trump announced that US forces had captured Maduro and his wife during what officials called Operation Absolute Resolve[8][9]. The military operation involved more than 150 aircraft striking Venezuelan military installations and disabling the country's air defenses before special forces extracted Maduro from Caracas[9][10].</description>

      <title>Restoring coral reefs could boost seafood yields 50%</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/restoring-coral-reefs-could-fe-WX0.t26JSGub4K1LcbZ3wQ</link>
      <description>Allowing overfished coral reef populations to recover could boost sustainable seafood yields by nearly 50 percent and help feed millions worldwide, according to research published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences[1][2][3].

Scientists at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama and collaborators analyzed 1,211 reef sites across 23 jurisdictions, finding that depleted fish stocks produce far less food than their sustainable potential[4][5]. The study, led by Jessica Zamborain-Mason of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, calculated that recovery could generate between 20,000 and 162 million additional sustainable fish servings per country annually—enough to meet recommended seafood intake for up to 1.4 million additional people per year[6][1][5].

"Our study quantifies how much is being lost by having overfished reef fish communities in terms of food provisioning and, in turn, how much could be gained from rebuilding reef fish stocks and managing them at sustainable levels," Zamborain-Mason said[6][1][4].</description>

      <title>Trump says U.S. 'absolutely needs' Greenland</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-reaffirms-greenland-anne-.SkSv3inRRWdO8mYSm97Tw</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump on Sunday reaffirmed his intention to acquire Greenland, telling The Atlantic magazine "we absolutely need Greenland" for national security, describing the island as surrounded by Russian and Chinese ships[1][2]. The renewed pressure on Denmark came just hours after a controversial U.S. military operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, sparking fears among European allies that Trump's expansionist rhetoric could extend to the Arctic territory.

The timing amplified diplomatic tensions when Katie Miller, wife of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, posted an image of Greenland draped in the American flag on social media late Saturday with a single word: "SOON"[3][4][5]. Denmark's ambassador to the United States, Jesper Moeller Soerensen, responded swiftly, declaring his country expects "full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark"[3][4].</description>

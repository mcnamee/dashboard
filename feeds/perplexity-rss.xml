      <title>Venezuela approves law ending 20 years of state oil control</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/venezuela-approves-historic-oi-LPgBSK6XSHufeNdUmJwfkg</link>
      <description>Venezuela's National Assembly on Thursday approved a sweeping reform to the country's hydrocarbons law, ending more than two decades of state control over the nation's oil sector and opening the door to private investment in the world's largest proven crude reserves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The vote marks a dramatic departure from the socialist economic model that has governed Venezuela since former President Hugo Chávez nationalized the industry in the mid-2000s. The legislation comes less than a month after the U.S. military captured then-President Nicolás Maduro in Caracas on January 3.</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-plans-talks-with-iran-am-TWVP2QJfSBuO0d299yRWvg</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump confirmed on Thursday that he is planning to hold direct talks with Iran as tensions between Washington and Tehran escalate, pairing diplomatic signals with warnings about the naval forces now positioned near the Islamic Republic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I have had and I am planning on it," Trump told reporters at the Kennedy Center when asked about potential discussions with Iran. He simultaneously emphasized the military pressure, stating, "We have a lot of very big, very powerful ships sailing to Iran right now, and it would be great if we didn't have to use them".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking to CBS News on Thursday, Trump revealed he has communicated two key demands to Iran in recent conversations: "No. 1, no nuclear. And No. 2, stop killing protesters".</description>

      <title>NASA simulations reveal magnetic chaos before neutron stars collide</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/nasa-simulates-merging-neutron-X9OC4z3AT8SGpg5AJfUkyw</link>
      <description>NASA researchers have unveiled supercomputer simulations that provide an unprecedented view into the chaotic magnetic interactions between neutron stars in the final moments before they collide, identifying potential electromagnetic signals that future observatories could detect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new findings, announced by NASA on January 29, offer scientists their most detailed look yet at how the magnetospheres—highly magnetized, plasma-filled regions surrounding neutron stars—behave as the city-sized stellar remnants spiral toward a cataclysmic merger. The research, led by Dimitrios Skiathas, a graduate student at the University of Patras in Greece conducting work at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, was published in The Astrophysical Journal.</description>

      <description>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has been traversing our solar system since its discovery in July 2025, continues to reveal unusual features that have prompted scientists to propose a global early warning network for detecting future visitors from beyond our cosmic neighborhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new scientific proposal led by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb and co-authored with graduate researcher Oem Trivedi outlines what they describe as the Comprehensive Interstellar Objects Network, or CISON. The framework argues that humanity is currently underprepared to detect and respond to fast-moving objects arriving from interstellar space.</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/ubs-raises-gold-price-target-t-qmnkTG_.QMecros31L16qQ</link>
      <description>UBS has increased its gold price target to $6,200 per ounce for March, June, and September 2026, up from its previous forecast of $5,000, citing stronger-than-expected demand stemming from increased investment flows and central bank buying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The upgrade came as spot gold surged to an all-time high of $5,594.82 on Thursday, extending a remarkable rally that has seen the precious metal climb more than 27% since the beginning of the year. The safe-haven metal has now achieved record highs for nine consecutive sessions.</description>

      <description>Europe's three aerospace giants—Airbus, Leonardo, and Thales—are moving toward creating a unified European space company as the continent races to compete with American rivals and close what industry leaders describe as a widening capability gap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The companies signed a Memorandum of Understanding in October 2025 to merge their space operations into a single entity that would employ approximately 25,000 people and generate about €6.5 billion in annual revenue. The venture, expected to become operational in 2027 pending regulatory approvals, would see Airbus hold a 35% stake while Leonardo and Thales each take 32.5%.</description>

      <description>An international team of astronomers has produced the clearest picture yet of the Milky Way's magnetic field, revealing a landscape of hidden complexity that challenges previous assumptions about our galaxy's invisible architecture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new map, created using data from the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory near Penticton, British Columbia, shows that more than half of the northern sky contains intricate magnetic structures rather than the simple, uniform fields scientists once expected. The research, led by the University of British Columbia Okanagan, was published this week in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series.</description>

      <description>A joint investigation by The Associated Press and The Gecko Project has revealed that Bea Mountain Mining Corporation, Liberia's largest gold mining company, repeatedly leaked cyanide, arsenic, and copper from its facilities into local waterways at levels exceeding legal limits, contaminating rivers that nearby communities depend on for drinking water and fishing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The investigation, based on reports retrieved from Liberia's Environmental Protection Agency after they were removed from its website, documents four confirmed spills between 2016 and 2023 at the company's New Liberty mine in Grand Cape Mount County. Residents of Jikandor village, located downstream from the mine, said they have been forced to reckon with an impossible choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"If we don't move, we will die," village chief Mustapha Pabai told reporters.</description>

      <description>As Ukraine enters the fourth year of its war with Russia, the country is grappling with a deepening manpower crisis that has forced young recruits barely out of their teens onto the deadliest parts of the front line, while units across the battlefield operate at a fraction of their intended strength.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The scale of the crisis was laid bare this month when newly appointed Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov told parliament that two million Ukrainians are wanted for evading military service, while 200,000 soldiers have gone absent without leave. The 34-year-old Fedorov, who took over the ministry with what he described as a 300 billion hryvnia ($6.9 billion) budget deficit, called for urgent reforms to address problems "that have accumulated over the years".</description>

      <description>The United Nations is on the brink of "imminent financial collapse" and could run out of cash by July, Secretary-General António Guterres warned in a letter to ambassadors dated January 28, marking the most severe funding crisis in the organization's 80-year history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The crisis is deepening, threatening programme delivery and risking financial collapse. And the situation will deteriorate further in the near future," Guterres wrote in the correspondence, obtained by Reuters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The alarm comes weeks after President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on January 7 directing the withdrawal of the United States from 66 international organizations, including 31 UN entities, deeming them "contrary to the interests of the United States".</description>

      <description>Novak Djokovic turned back the clock in the early hours of Saturday morning in Melbourne, outlasting two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner in a grueling five-set semifinal to reach his 11th Australian Open final. The 38-year-old Serbian prevailed 3-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 in four hours and nine minutes, finishing at 1:32 a.m. local time, to become the oldest man in the Open Era to reach the championship match at Melbourne Park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The victory snapped Djokovic's five-match losing streak against Sinner, his first win over the Italian since November 2023, and propelled him one match away from a record-extending 25th Grand Slam title that would surpass Margaret Court's all-time mark of 24 major singles championships.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump has confirmed he is in talks with Iranian leaders while deploying a major naval fleet to the Persian Gulf, escalating pressure on Tehran to accept U.S. demands on its nuclear program or face military action he warns will be "far worse" than last year's strikes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I have had, and I am planning on it," Trump said Friday when asked about recent conversations with Iran, adding that he conveyed two conditions: "No nukes. And two, stop killing protesters."

      <description>President Donald Trump has dispatched a substantial U.S. naval fleet to the Persian Gulf in an escalating standoff with Iran, warning Tehran on Thursday that "time is running out" to negotiate a nuclear agreement or face military action he described as "far worse" than the June 2025 strikes that targeted Iranian nuclear facilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The deployment, which Trump has repeatedly called a "massive Armada," is led by the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and now includes at least six guided-missile destroyers in the region, with the USS Delbert D. Black crossing into the Red Sea on January 29 and docking at Israel's port of Eilat on Friday. The carrier strike group entered the Middle East region on January 26 after departing the South China Sea earlier this month.</description>

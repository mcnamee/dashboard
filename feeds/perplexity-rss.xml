      <title>UN study links Iran's protest hotspots to water crisis zones</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/environmental-crisis-drives-ir-3nFIi39UQ927C7Qr76OIyg</link>
      <description>The anti-government protests convulsing Iran since late December are rooted not only in economic collapse and political repression but in a deeper, environmental catastrophe that has reached an inflection point. Dwindling water supplies, poisonous air, and crumbling infrastructure have compelled Iranians to take to the streets in the deadliest uprising the country has seen in decades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new analysis published this week by Nima Shokri of the United Nations University reveals a pattern: protests are more likely to erupt in areas suffering from groundwater depletion, land subsidence, and water rationing. Provinces such as Tehran, Khuzestan in the southwest, and Isfahan in central Iran, all regions with high levels of protest, are grappling with acute water shortages and disputes over access.</description>

      <title>Asian stocks climb as investors look past Trump tariff threats</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/asian-stocks-rise-following-wa-qUxlf5o3TD26_bps72ZH.A</link>
      <description>Asian markets climbed on Tuesday as investors looked past President Donald Trump's warning of higher tariffs on South Korean goods, choosing instead to track Wall Street's gains and position for a pivotal week of tech earnings and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Kospi index rebounded sharply, rising over 2% and reclaiming the 5,000 level after earlier losses sparked by Trump's tariff announcement. The benchmark index had dipped in early trading before sentiment improved following comments from South Korea's presidential office indicating it had not been notified of any tariff plans in advance.</description>

      <title>New AI tool identifies genes across species without lab experiments</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/ai-tool-helixer-revolutionizes-m481JUNHQlilcyWb5OGeOA</link>
      <description>Researchers at Germany's Forschungszentrum Jülich and Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf have unveiled Helixer, an artificial intelligence tool that can identify genes directly from raw DNA sequences without requiring laboratory experiments or prior knowledge about the organism being studied. The results, published in Nature Methods, mark a major step forward in addressing a long-standing bottleneck in genome research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gene annotation—the process of locating genes within long strings of DNA letters—has long been one of the most challenging aspects of genome analysis. While genome sequencing was automated more than two decades ago, the interpretation of that data has lagged far behind. Helixer changes this by using deep learning combined with a hidden Markov model to detect typical features of genes, including start and stop signals and structural elements such as exons and introns.</description>

      <title>AI tools accelerate solid-state battery research in Asia</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/ai-accelerates-solid-state-bat-PX2Y_EoJTfO96UfEtDAjKg</link>
      <description>Researchers across Asia are leveraging artificial intelligence to transform how solid-state batteries are developed, with two major advances announced this week that could speed the transition from conventional lithium-ion technology to safer, more energy-dense alternatives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A review article published in the journal AI Agent by Tohoku University researchers outlines how AI agents are moving beyond isolated predictions to coordinate multi-step research strategies for discovering solid electrolytes, the materials that could replace flammable liquid electrolytes in next-generation batteries. Meanwhile, a team at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) has developed an AI framework that predicts cathode particle sizes with 86.6% accuracy while also indicating the reliability of its predictions.</description>

      <title>India and China cut power emissions together for first time since 1973</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/india-and-china-cut-power-emis-f1jiCElwQKuWzgt17pUh.Q</link>
      <description>Power sector emissions in China and India declined simultaneously in 2025 for the first time in over five decades, according to a new report from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), as record clean energy deployment in both nations offset a surge in coal use in the United States and helped keep global emissions largely flat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last time both countries registered a simultaneous drop in coal power output was 1973, during the global oil crisis.</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/india-and-eu-sign-landmark-fre-Aye1ecV8TdWVhrA.FMWaVw</link>
      <description>India and the European Union finalized a free trade agreement on Tuesday after nearly two decades of negotiations, creating a market of 2 billion people and representing approximately 25 percent of global economic output. The announcement came at the 16th India-EU Summit in New Delhi, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Yesterday a big agreement was signed between the European Union and India. People are calling this the mother of all deals," Modi said while inaugurating India Energy Week in Goa via video conferencing. The agreement covers about one-third of global trade and is expected to remove tariff and non-tariff barriers on more than 90 percent of goods traded between the two sides.</description>

      <title>Chinese scientists claim stealth bomber tech up to 62% faster</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/china-unveils-tech-to-boost-st-mc_nKM8QQa2liA_6Y1oiOw</link>
      <description>Chinese aerospace scientists have developed an active flutter suppression system that enables flying wing aircraft to operate 62.5 percent faster than previously possible while retaining their stealth characteristics, according to peer-reviewed research published in December and announced by Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics last month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The breakthrough addresses a fundamental limitation that has constrained stealth bomber designs for decades: the trade-off between radar invisibility and speed. While flying wing aircraft like the U.S. B-2 Spirit excel at evading detection, their tailless design makes them vulnerable to dangerous vibrations at high speeds, forcing designers to limit them to subsonic flight.</description>

      <description>The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists advanced the Doomsday Clock to 85 seconds before midnight on Tuesday, marking the closest the symbolic timepiece has ever been to catastrophe. The four-second move from 89 seconds, set in January 2025, reflects what scientists say are intensifying nuclear threats, accelerating climate change, and the growing risks posed by artificial intelligence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Doomsday Clock's message cannot be clearer," Alexandra Bell, president and CEO of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, said at the announcement. "Catastrophic destruction, primarily due to nuclear risks and other global threats," is becoming increasingly probable, according to the organization.</description>

      <description>Prime Minister Mark Carney told President Donald Trump that Canada stands by its trade diversification strategy and recent deal with China during a phone call Monday, pushing back against claims from the Trump administration that he had backed down from his earlier criticism of American trade policy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I meant what I said in Davos," Carney told reporters Tuesday before a cabinet meeting in Ottawa. "Canada was the first country to understand the change in U.S. trade policy that he had initiated, and we're responding to that."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The call comes amid escalating tensions between Washington and Ottawa as the two countries prepare for a formal review of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement later this year. Trump had threatened over the weekend to impose 100% tariffs on Canadian goods if Canada proceeds with a trade agreement with China, posting on Truth Social that Prime Minister Carney was "gravely mistaken" if he thought Canada could become a "Drop Off Port" for Chinese products.</description>

      <description>Lunai Bioworks on Tuesday announced the deployment of Sentinel, a transformer-based AI safeguard designed to prevent large language models and scientific AI systems from generating novel chemical agents. The Sacramento-based biotech company said the technology embeds directly within foundation models to screen molecular outputs in real time, functioning as what CEO David Weinstein described as "the immune system for scientific AI."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"As AI models become more powerful, safety has to move closer to the core," Weinstein said in a statement. "Sentinel operates inside AI systems—not outside them—stopping dangerous chemical designs before they are ever produced."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The launch comes amid mounting concern over the dual-use risks of advanced AI in chemistry and biology, with major AI companies including Anthropic and OpenAI warning that powerful models could assist bad actors in developing biological and chemical threats.</description>

      <title>Trump asks countries to pay $1 billion for permanent peace board seats</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-wants-nations-to-pay-1-b-juzl8dT9Sj2TkEURIgx_zA</link>
      <description>The Trump administration is asking countries that want a permanent spot on President Donald Trump's new Board of Peace to contribute at least $1 billion, according to a draft charter of the body sent to world leaders this weekend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The provision, outlined in the charter distributed alongside invitation letters on Friday, effectively creates a two-tier membership structure. Countries that contribute $1 billion or more in cash funds to the Board of Peace would be exempt from the standard three-year membership term, securing them a permanent seat on the panel.</description>

      <title>EU lawmakers move to freeze US trade deal after Trump tariffs</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/eu-halts-us-trade-deal-approva-Ibq3iLbcSzGJ54hUAhhSug</link>
      <description>European Union lawmakers are poised to freeze approval of the EU-US trade deal after President Donald Trump announced tariffs on eight NATO allies Saturday in his latest bid to acquire Greenland. The move marks a dramatic escalation in transatlantic tensions, jeopardizing the landmark agreement struck just six months ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Manfred Weber, president of the European People's Party—the largest political faction in the European Parliament—declared that proceeding with the trade deal is no longer feasible. "The EPP is in favor of the EU-US trade deal, but given Donald Trump's threats regarding Greenland, approval is not possible at this stage," Weber posted on social media Saturday, adding that "zero tariffs on US products must now be put on hold."</description>

      <description>Ambassadors from the European Union's 27 member states will convene for an emergency meeting on Sunday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a wave of escalating tariffs on European allies over their opposition to the American acquisition of Greenland, an unprecedented move that threatens to fracture the transatlantic alliance and ignite a new trade war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cyprus, which holds the EU's six-month rotating presidency, called the urgent session late Saturday, with diplomats indicating it is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. GMT. European Council President António Costa confirmed he is coordinating a collective response from member states, stating, "The EU will maintain its stance on upholding international law, wherever it is applicable".</description>

      <description>The artificial intelligence revolution is reshaping the global energy landscape, with tech giants racing to secure nuclear power contracts as data center electricity consumption threatens to strain power grids worldwide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Global electricity demand is expected to increase by more than 10,000 terawatt-hours by 2035, a figure equivalent to the total consumption of all advanced economies today, according to a UN report released this week. The International Energy Agency estimates that data center electricity demand grew by more than 75 percent between 2023 and 2024, and the sector is expected to account for over 20 percent of electricity-demand growth in advanced economies by 2030.</description>

      <title>Iran confirms 5,000 dead in crackdown as protests subside</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/iran-crackdown-kills-thousands-hYFd_ZThSVSRVI_zuqnNpA</link>
      <description>An Iranian official acknowledged on Sunday that authorities have verified at least 5,000 deaths during three weeks of nationwide protests, the first such confirmation from within the government as the Islamic Republic's deadliest crackdown in decades appears to have temporarily suppressed street demonstrations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The figure, which includes approximately 500 security personnel, was disclosed by a regional official speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity. The official blamed "terrorists and armed rioters" for the casualties, while attributing support for protesters to "Israel and armed groups abroad." The acknowledgment follows Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's admission on Saturday that "several thousand" had died during the unrest.</description>

      <description>Chinese customs authorities have blocked shipments of NVIDIA Corporation's H200 artificial intelligence processors, prompting suppliers of specialized components to halt production amid what industry analysts describe as a sudden and unexpected reversal in trade relations between the world's two largest economies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The move, first reported by the Financial Times on January 16, came after customs officials in Shenzhen summoned logistics companies on January 7 and instructed them not to accept customs clearance applications for H200 chips. Early shipments of H200s were already arriving in Hong Kong when the blockade took effect, catching Nvidia off guard, according to sources familiar with the matter.</description>

      <title>Iran president warns attack on Khamenei means 'all-out war'</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/iran-president-warns-strikes-o-_Yk45mnwSxCHdtrv9fmNgg</link>
      <description>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian declared Sunday that any attack on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would be "tantamount to all-out war against the Iranian nation," escalating a war of words with Washington after President Donald Trump called for "new leadership" in Tehran.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Any aggression against the supreme leader of our country is tantamount to all-out war against the Iranian nation," Pezeshkian wrote on the social media platform X. The Iranian president also blamed Washington for his country's economic struggles, citing "longstanding enmity and inhumane sanctions" imposed by the United States and its allies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pezeshkian's warning followed a sharp exchange between Trump and Khamenei on Saturday. In an interview with Politico, Trump said "it's time to look for new leadership in Iran," calling the 86-year-old supreme leader "a sick man who should run his country properly and stop killing people". Trump added that Iran under Khamenei's rule was "the worst place to live anywhere in the world because of poor leadership".</description>

      <description>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer directly challenged President Donald Trump on Sunday, telling him in a phone call that imposing tariffs on NATO allies over Greenland is "wrong." The conversation came one day after Trump announced sweeping tariffs against eight European nations in his latest effort to pressure Denmark into selling the Arctic territory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to an official Downing Street statement, Starmer spoke with Trump after first coordinating with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. "He said that security in the High North is a priority for all NATO allies in order to protect Euro-Atlantic interests," Downing Street said. "He also said that applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is wrong."</description>

      <description>The Syrian government and the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces reached a ceasefire agreement on Sunday following days of intense combat that saw government troops rapidly advance through Kurdish-held territories in the country's north and east, seizing strategic oil fields and key cities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa and SDF commander Mazloum Abdi signed the 14-point accord, which state media described as an "immediate and comprehensive" halt to hostilities across all fronts. The agreement marks a watershed moment in Damascus's efforts to reassert control over nearly all of Syria following the toppling of Bashar Assad in December 2024.</description>

      <description>Sequoia Capital is joining a blockbuster funding round for Anthropic that values the AI startup at $350 billion, according to the Financial Times. The move breaks with long-standing venture capital tradition by backing a direct competitor to OpenAI and xAI, both of which are already in Sequoia's portfolio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The funding round is led by Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC and U.S. investor Coatue, with each contributing $1.5 billion. Anthropic is targeting a total raise of $25 billion or more, which would close to double its $183 billion valuation from September's Series F round.</description>

      <description>At least 21 people were killed and up to 100 injured when two high-speed trains collided in southern Spain on Sunday evening after one derailed and crossed into the path of an oncoming service, prompting authorities to suspend all rail traffic between Madrid and the Andalusia region.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The crash occurred at approximately 6:40 p.m. local time near the town of Adamuz in Córdoba province when an Iryo train traveling from Málaga to Madrid derailed and struck a Renfe train heading from Madrid to Huelva, according to Spanish rail network operator Adif. Both trains were carrying hundreds of passengers—roughly 300 on the Iryo service and around 100 to 200 on the Renfe train.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spain's Transport Minister Óscar Puente confirmed the death toll after midnight, stating that all survivors had been rescued from the wreckage. Among those killed was the driver of the Renfe train, according to state broadcaster Televisión Española. Officials said 25 of the injured sustained serious wounds, with 73 passengers transported to six different hospitals.</description>

      <description>The European Union is weighing tariffs on up to €93 billion ($108 billion) worth of American goods and considering unprecedented trade countermeasures after President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 10% levy on eight European countries unless Washington is allowed to purchase Greenland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EU ambassadors from all 27 member states convened for an emergency meeting in Brussels on Sunday following Trump's announcement on Saturday that tariffs would take effect February 1 on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland. The president warned the rate would rise to 25% by June 1 unless a deal is reached for the "Complete and Total purchase of Greenland."</description>

      <description>The International Monetary Fund on Monday upgraded economic growth forecasts for both India and Nigeria, positioning them among the strongest performers in their respective regions as global growth remains steady despite lingering trade tensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In its January 2026 World Economic Outlook update, the IMF raised India's FY26 growth estimate by 0.7 percentage points to 7.3%, citing a "better-than-expected outturn in the third quarter" and strong momentum heading into the final months of the fiscal year. The Fund expects growth to moderate to 6.4% in both 2026 and 2027 "as cyclical and temporary factors wane".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nigeria's 2026 growth outlook was raised to 4.4% from 4.2% projected in October, with the IMF citing improved macroeconomic stability and the government's ongoing reform efforts.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump's threat to impose escalating tariffs on eight European nations until the U.S. is allowed to buy Greenland has roiled global markets, sent gold and silver to record highs, and prompted European leaders to consider unprecedented countermeasures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump announced Saturday that he would levy a 10% tariff on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, and the United Kingdom starting February 1, rising to 25% by June 1 unless an agreement is reached for the "complete and total purchase of Greenland."</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump has told Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre that he "no longer feels an obligation to think purely of peace" after being denied the Nobel Peace Prize, using the perceived slight to justify his demand for American control over Greenland in a letter that has sent shockwaves through transatlantic relations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The letter, first reported by PBS journalist Nick Schifrin on Sunday and confirmed by multiple outlets including Bloomberg and Reuters, was shared by Trump's National Security Council with several European ambassadors in Washington.</description>

      <description>China recorded its lowest birth rate since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, with just 7.92 million babies born in 2025, according to official data released Monday by the National Bureau of Statistics. The figure represents a 17% decline from the 9.54 million births recorded in 2024, dashing hopes that a modest uptick last year signaled a reversal of the country's deepening demographic crisis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The birth rate fell to 5.63 births per 1,000 people, marking the lowest level in more than seven decades of record-keeping. Meanwhile, deaths climbed to 11.31 million, the highest mortality rate since 1968, resulting in a net population decline of 3.39 million. China's total population now stands at 1.405 billion, shrinking for the fourth consecutive year.</description>

      <title>Australian researchers build motor powered by liquid metal</title>

      <description>Researchers at the University of New South Wales have developed a motor that operates using a droplet of liquid metal instead of traditional rigid components—a breakthrough that could reshape the future of soft robotics, flexible electronics, and medical devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tiny device, called a liquid metal droplet rotary paddle motor, generates motion through swirling flows inside a liquid metal droplet embedded in a salt solution and exposed to an electric field. A small copper paddle placed within the swirling metal is carried along by these internal flows, creating rotation at speeds of up to 320 revolutions per minute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"This is a completely new way to create motion," said Dr Priyank Kumar, a UNSW Senior Lecturer who supervised the project and served as the corresponding author on a paper published in npj Flexible Electronics. "We're harnessing the flow of liquid metal itself to produce rotation, without any traditional moving parts. It's simple, compact, and inherently flexible".</description>

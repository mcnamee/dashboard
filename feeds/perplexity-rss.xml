      <title>Trump demands Greenland talks at Davos, rules out force</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-demands-greenland-talks-q9_uynS8Q0Cbr3GXWFSfKw</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump delivered a combative speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, using the global gathering to press his case for acquiring Greenland while criticizing European allies and calling Denmark "ungrateful" for refusing to cede the territory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"No nation or coalition of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States," Trump told the assembled business leaders and diplomats. "We're a great power, much greater than people even understand."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The speech came amid unprecedented tensions between the United States and its European allies, with Trump threatening tariffs on eight NATO countries unless they support his bid to purchase the semi-autonomous Danish territory.</description>

      <title>Canadian PM Carney says US-led global order is over</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/canadian-pm-carney-says-us-led-nvwdU2OxQFqSyCNl2nOPQQ</link>
      <description>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney declared the end of the American-led rules-based international order on Tuesday, urging "middle powers" like Canada to band together against coercion from larger nations in an address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland that delivered a direct rebuke to U.S. President Donald Trump's territorial ambitions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking in both French and English to the assembled global elite, Carney described a "rupture" in global affairs where "the powerful act as they wish, while the vulnerable endure what they must." The speech came just hours after Trump posted AI-generated images on Truth Social depicting American flags overlaid on Canada, Greenland, Cuba, and Venezuela.</description>

      <description>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen declared Wednesday that the European Union stands "at a crossroads" as tensions with the United States over Greenland escalate, warning that President Donald Trump's tariff threats risk triggering a "dangerous downward spiral" between allies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Europe prefers dialogue and solutions – but we are fully prepared to act, if necessary, with unity, urgency and determination," von der Leyen told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, signaling a more forceful approach to Trump's persistent pressure campaign to acquire the Arctic territory from Denmark.</description>

      <title>Unsealed emails show Microsoft pushed OpenAI toward rapid monetization</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/documents-reveal-microsoft-s-r-dg_QZTKZQKWHcdBGdkdQ0Q</link>
      <description>Newly unsealed internal communications from Elon Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft show how Microsoft executives actively shaped the AI startup's rapid pivot from a cautious nonprofit into one of the most valuable companies in technology. The documents, made public through legal discovery, offer a rare glimpse into the corporate maneuvering that transformed OpenAI from an obscure research lab into a company now valued at $500 billion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;GeekWire journalist Todd Bishop examined the cache of emails, memos, and text messages, revealing that Microsoft's leadership, including CEO Satya Nadella, pushed aggressively for monetization at critical junctures in OpenAI's development.</description>

      <description>A faded hand stencil found in a cave on Indonesia's Muna Island has been dated to at least 67,800 years ago, making it the oldest reliably dated rock art ever discovered. The finding, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, surpasses the previous record holder — hand stencils attributed to Neanderthals in Spain — by more than a millennium and offers new insights into early human migration toward Australia.</description>

      <title>Pew report finds Catholicism declining sharply across Latin America</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/pew-reports-decline-in-christi-uP_bO.uMQtG5IJW1JlC6fw</link>
      <description>A new report from the Pew Research Center released Wednesday reveals that Catholicism continues to decline across Latin America, with the Catholic share of the population falling by at least 9 percentage points in each of six major countries surveyed over the past decade. The findings mirror broader trends of Christian disaffiliation documented by Pew across Europe, where millions have left the faith since childhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The report, titled "Catholicism Has Declined in Latin America Over the Past Decade," is based on surveys of more than 6,200 adults conducted in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru between January and April 2024. These six nations collectively represent about 75% of Latin America's population.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Our analysis found that the Catholic share of the population in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru has significantly declined since 2013-14, while a growing share of adults in the region are religiously unaffiliated," said Kirsten Lesage, a Pew research associate and the report's lead author.</description>

      <title>Mountain regions warming faster than lowlands, threatening water for billions</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/climate-change-drives-extreme-Jz2dFQ5ST2WH6uLYJ4PZpQ</link>
      <description>The past 11 years have been the warmest in modern history, the World Meteorological Organization confirmed last week, as scientists warn that global warming is intensifying heatwaves, floods, and storms while threatening water supplies for more than a billion people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The WMO reported that 2025 ranked among the three warmest years on record, with global average surface temperatures reaching 1.44°C above pre-industrial levels. Six of eight international climate datasets ranked 2025 as the third-warmest year, while two ranked it second-warmest in the 176-year temperature record. The findings came despite the cooling influence of La Niña conditions at the start and end of the year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The year 2025 started and ended with a cooling La Niña and yet it was still one of the warmest years on record globally because of the accumulation of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in our atmosphere," said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.</description>

      <title>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS to reach optimal viewing alignment</title>

      <description>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has published an essay cataloguing 18 unusual characteristics of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, raising questions about whether the cosmic visitor could be artificial rather than a natural comet. The provocative analysis, titled "What if 3I/ATLAS Is AI/ATLAS?" arrives as the object approaches a rare near-opposition alignment on January 22, 2026, offering astronomers an unprecedented observational window.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loeb, the former chair of Harvard's astronomy department, states that 3I/ATLAS is "most likely natural" but argues the anomalies warrant investigation. He ranks the object at 4 on his self-devised 10-point "Loeb Scale" for interstellar significance.</description>

      <description>US President Donald Trump's newly created "Board of Peace" is gaining members while exposing rifts among Western nations, as the initiative designed to oversee Gaza's reconstruction expands into a broader conflict-resolution body that some fear could challenge the United Nations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Wednesday, divisions sharpened as Israel, Egypt, Bahrain, Azerbaijan, and Kosovo announced they would join the board, while Norway and Sweden followed France in declining the invitation. A White House official said about 30 countries are expected to sign on, with 50 having received invitations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump is scheduled to hold a formal signing ceremony Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where the charter will be officially established.</description>

      <title>US envoys to meet Putin Thursday as Ukraine peace talks advance</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/putin-receives-us-draft-peace-Qkwv885sSXiElsM3kDc1ig</link>
      <description>Russian President Vladimir Putin received an early draft of the U.S.-backed peace plan for Ukraine in early January through Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, according to a report by Bloomberg. The plan, which had been coordinated with Ukrainian and European partners, was delivered informally to give the Kremlin time to review the proposal and prepare feedback before expected high-level talks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The diplomatic maneuver comes as U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed Wednesday that he and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law, will travel to Moscow on Thursday to meet with Putin. "The Russians are the ones requesting this meeting. I believe this is a noteworthy indication on their part," Witkoff said at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</description>

      <description>Denmark on Wednesday rejected any deal or talks to transfer its sovereignty over Greenland to the United States, hours after President Donald Trump called for "immediate negotiations" on acquiring the Arctic territory but ruled out using military force during his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen welcomed Trump's statement that he would not use force but made clear that the issue was far from resolved. "It is positive that it is being said that military force will not be used. But that will not make this case go away," Rasmussen said following a meeting of the Foreign Policy Committee in Copenhagen, according to public broadcaster TV2.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump announced Wednesday he will hold off on imposing tariffs on eight European nations after reaching what he called "the framework of a future deal" with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte regarding Greenland and the Arctic region.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The surprise announcement came just hours after Trump used his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos to reiterate demands for "immediate negotiations" on the United States acquiring the Danish territory, marking a dramatic de-escalation in a dispute that had rattled transatlantic relations for weeks.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump told a gathering of global elites at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday that he would not deploy military force to take control of Greenland, easing fears of a transatlantic crisis that triggered Wall Street's steepest selloff in three months just one day earlier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force," Trump declared in his keynote address in Davos, Switzerland, adding that "people thought I would use force" and calling his pledge "probably the biggest statement I made." While ruling out military action, Trump called for "immediate negotiations" with Denmark to transfer ownership of the Arctic territory.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump delivered a defiant 72-minute speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday, ruling out military force to acquire Greenland while demanding "immediate negotiations" with Denmark over the Arctic territory and criticizing European allies as heading in the "wrong direction."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The address, widely anticipated as a pivotal moment in escalating transatlantic tensions, saw Trump claim Greenland as American territory while simultaneously attempting to reassure nervous European partners. "We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. But I won't do that," Trump told the audience of billionaires, government officials, and diplomats.</description>

      <description>At a World Economic Forum panel in Davos on Wednesday, NATO's top officials delivered a unified message: despite U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive push to acquire Greenland, Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression must remain the alliance's primary focus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, speaking alongside Polish President Karol Nawrocki and Finnish President Alexander Stubb during a panel titled "Can Europe Defend Itself?", warned against allowing the Greenland dispute to overshadow the war in Ukraine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Greenland, "we have to make sure that that issue gets solved in an amicable way,” Rutte said. “But the main issue is not Greenland now, the main issue is Ukraine,” he added, warning that leaders risk “dropping the ball” by focusing too much on Greenland instead of Ukraine.</description>

      <description>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Wednesday that he has agreed to join U.S. President Donald Trump's Board of Peace, reversing course just days after his office criticized the initiative's leadership structure for including Turkey and Qatar without Israel's consultation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Prime Minister Netanyahu announced that he has accepted US President Donald Trump's invitation and will join as a member of the Board of Peace, which will be composed of leaders of the world," his office stated on social media. The decision sets up a potential clash with far-right coalition partners who have condemned Trump's Gaza governance framework.</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/climate-change-drives-extreme-dWIQ1HGuSzaFhYEDwsFT5g</link>
      <description>The last three years have been the hottest since the pre-industrial era, according to annual climate reports, as global temperatures continue to drive more intense heatwaves, wildfires, floods, and tropical storms. Yet despite the escalating intensity of extreme weather events, the relationship between climate change and human mortality is proving more complex than raw numbers suggest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new analysis by AFP, based on data from the EM-DAT global disaster database, found that more than 2.3 million people died from weather-related events between 1970 and 2025. While that figure is staggering, the death toll between 2015 and 2025 actually declined to 305,156, down from 354,428 in the previous decade.</description>

      <title>Chinese scientists claim stealth bomber tech up to 62% faster</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/china-unveils-tech-to-boost-st-mc_nKM8QQa2liA_6Y1oiOw</link>
      <description>Chinese aerospace scientists have developed an active flutter suppression system that enables flying wing aircraft to operate 62.5 percent faster than previously possible while retaining their stealth characteristics, according to peer-reviewed research published in December and announced by Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics last month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The breakthrough addresses a fundamental limitation that has constrained stealth bomber designs for decades: the trade-off between radar invisibility and speed. While flying wing aircraft like the U.S. B-2 Spirit excel at evading detection, their tailless design makes them vulnerable to dangerous vibrations at high speeds, forcing designers to limit them to subsonic flight.</description>

      <description>The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists advanced the Doomsday Clock to 85 seconds before midnight on Tuesday, marking the closest the symbolic timepiece has ever been to catastrophe. The four-second move from 89 seconds, set in January 2025, reflects what scientists say are intensifying nuclear threats, accelerating climate change, and the growing risks posed by artificial intelligence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Doomsday Clock's message cannot be clearer," Alexandra Bell, president and CEO of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, said at the announcement. "Catastrophic destruction, primarily due to nuclear risks and other global threats," is becoming increasingly probable, according to the organization.</description>

      <description>Prime Minister Mark Carney told President Donald Trump that Canada stands by its trade diversification strategy and recent deal with China during a phone call Monday, pushing back against claims from the Trump administration that he had backed down from his earlier criticism of American trade policy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I meant what I said in Davos," Carney told reporters Tuesday before a cabinet meeting in Ottawa. "Canada was the first country to understand the change in U.S. trade policy that he had initiated, and we're responding to that."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The call comes amid escalating tensions between Washington and Ottawa as the two countries prepare for a formal review of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement later this year. Trump had threatened over the weekend to impose 100% tariffs on Canadian goods if Canada proceeds with a trade agreement with China, posting on Truth Social that Prime Minister Carney was "gravely mistaken" if he thought Canada could become a "Drop Off Port" for Chinese products.</description>

      <description>Lunai Bioworks on Tuesday announced the deployment of Sentinel, a transformer-based AI safeguard designed to prevent large language models and scientific AI systems from generating novel chemical agents. The Sacramento-based biotech company said the technology embeds directly within foundation models to screen molecular outputs in real time, functioning as what CEO David Weinstein described as "the immune system for scientific AI."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"As AI models become more powerful, safety has to move closer to the core," Weinstein said in a statement. "Sentinel operates inside AI systems—not outside them—stopping dangerous chemical designs before they are ever produced."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The launch comes amid mounting concern over the dual-use risks of advanced AI in chemistry and biology, with major AI companies including Anthropic and OpenAI warning that powerful models could assist bad actors in developing biological and chemical threats.</description>

      <description>Narrow bands of ocean covering just over one-third of the world's seas are responsible for absorbing nearly three-quarters of the carbon dioxide that oceans pull from the atmosphere, according to new research that reshapes scientific understanding of Earth's carbon cycle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study, published in Nature Climate Change, reveals that ocean fronts—turbulent boundaries where different water masses collide—cover 36 percent of the global ocean but account for 72 percent of total oceanic carbon dioxide uptake, absorbing approximately 1.8 billion tons of carbon annually.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"This is the first time we've been able to quantify the disproportionate role that ocean fronts play in absorbing atmospheric CO2 on a global scale, and it has major implications for climate modelling," said lead author Dr. Kai Yang, who completed the research during his PhD at the University of Tasmania's Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) and is now a postdoctoral researcher at Xiamen University in China.</description>

      <description>Tesla faces a crossroads this week as its brand value hits a three-year low and Wall Street braces for another year of declining profitability. The electric vehicle maker is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2025 earnings on Wednesday, January 28, amid mounting evidence that CEO Elon Musk's political activities and the company's aging vehicle lineup are weighing heavily on business performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Brand Finance, Tesla's brand value fell by $15.4 billion, or 36%, in 2025, marking its third consecutive annual decline. The London-based research firm now values the Tesla brand at $27.61 billion, down from $43 billion at the start of 2025 and well below its peak of $66.2 billion in January 2023.</description>

      <description>Jupiter's moon Europa remains one of the most tantalizing targets in the search for extraterrestrial life, but two recent studies paint a complex and sometimes contradictory picture of whether its vast subsurface ocean could actually support living organisms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NASA announced on Sunday that data from the Juno spacecraft has provided the first direct measurement of Europa's ice shell thickness, determining it averages about 18 miles (29 kilometers) in the region observed during a 2022 flyby. The findings, published in Nature Astronomy in December, represent a landmark measurement that settles a long-standing scientific debate over whether the shell is thin or thick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The 18-mile estimate relates to the cold, rigid, conductive outer-layer of a pure water ice shell," said Steve Levin, Juno project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "If an inner, slightly warmer convective layer also exists, which is possible, the total ice shell thickness would be even greater."</description>

      <description>Colombian President Gustavo Petro said Tuesday that ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro should be returned to face trial in his home country rather than in the United States, adding a new layer of complexity to regional tensions one week before his scheduled meeting with President Donald Trump.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"They have to return him and have him tried by a Venezuelan court, not a US one," Petro said Tuesday, according to Bloomberg. The statement marks the Colombian leader's most direct intervention yet in the diplomatic standoff over Maduro's fate since US forces captured the former Venezuelan president in a dramatic pre-dawn raid on January 3.</description>

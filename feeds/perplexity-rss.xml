      <title>US envoys to meet Putin Thursday as Ukraine peace talks advance</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/putin-receives-us-draft-peace-Qkwv885sSXiElsM3kDc1ig</link>
      <description>Russian President Vladimir Putin received an early draft of the U.S.-backed peace plan for Ukraine in early January through Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, according to a report by Bloomberg. The plan, which had been coordinated with Ukrainian and European partners, was delivered informally to give the Kremlin time to review the proposal and prepare feedback before expected high-level talks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The diplomatic maneuver comes as U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed Wednesday that he and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law, will travel to Moscow on Thursday to meet with Putin. "The Russians are the ones requesting this meeting. I believe this is a noteworthy indication on their part," Witkoff said at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</description>

      <title>Denmark rejects Greenland talks after Trump rules out military force</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/denmark-and-greenland-firmly-r-6JW1nyXWT3et055.TDrm5Q</link>
      <description>Denmark on Wednesday rejected any deal or talks to transfer its sovereignty over Greenland to the United States, hours after President Donald Trump called for "immediate negotiations" on acquiring the Arctic territory but ruled out using military force during his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen welcomed Trump's statement that he would not use force but made clear that the issue was far from resolved. "It is positive that it is being said that military force will not be used. But that will not make this case go away," Rasmussen said following a meeting of the Foreign Policy Committee in Copenhagen, according to public broadcaster TV2.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump announced Wednesday he will hold off on imposing tariffs on eight European nations after reaching what he called "the framework of a future deal" with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte regarding Greenland and the Arctic region.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The surprise announcement came just hours after Trump used his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos to reiterate demands for "immediate negotiations" on the United States acquiring the Danish territory, marking a dramatic de-escalation in a dispute that had rattled transatlantic relations for weeks.</description>

      <description>President Donald Trump told a gathering of global elites at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday that he would not deploy military force to take control of Greenland, easing fears of a transatlantic crisis that triggered Wall Street's steepest selloff in three months just one day earlier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force," Trump declared in his keynote address in Davos, Switzerland, adding that "people thought I would use force" and calling his pledge "probably the biggest statement I made." While ruling out military action, Trump called for "immediate negotiations" with Denmark to transfer ownership of the Arctic territory.</description>

      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/trump-addresses-davos-amid-gre-waIO7giWR3Gi39.B2BKXcQ</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump delivered a defiant 72-minute speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday, ruling out military force to acquire Greenland while demanding "immediate negotiations" with Denmark over the Arctic territory and criticizing European allies as heading in the "wrong direction."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The address, widely anticipated as a pivotal moment in escalating transatlantic tensions, saw Trump claim Greenland as American territory while simultaneously attempting to reassure nervous European partners. "We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. But I won't do that," Trump told the audience of billionaires, government officials, and diplomats.</description>

      <description>At a World Economic Forum panel in Davos on Wednesday, NATO's top officials delivered a unified message: despite U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive push to acquire Greenland, Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression must remain the alliance's primary focus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, speaking alongside Polish President Karol Nawrocki and Finnish President Alexander Stubb during a panel titled "Can Europe Defend Itself?", warned against allowing the Greenland dispute to overshadow the war in Ukraine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Greenland, "we have to make sure that that issue gets solved in an amicable way,” Rutte said. “But the main issue is not Greenland now, the main issue is Ukraine,” he added, warning that leaders risk “dropping the ball” by focusing too much on Greenland instead of Ukraine.</description>

      <description>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Wednesday that he has agreed to join U.S. President Donald Trump's Board of Peace, reversing course just days after his office criticized the initiative's leadership structure for including Turkey and Qatar without Israel's consultation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Prime Minister Netanyahu announced that he has accepted US President Donald Trump's invitation and will join as a member of the Board of Peace, which will be composed of leaders of the world," his office stated on social media. The decision sets up a potential clash with far-right coalition partners who have condemned Trump's Gaza governance framework.</description>

      <title>Heat deaths hit record 66,825 in 2024 even as disaster deaths decline</title>
      <link>https://perplexity.ai/discover/you/climate-change-drives-extreme-dWIQ1HGuSzaFhYEDwsFT5g</link>
      <description>The last three years have been the hottest since the pre-industrial era, according to annual climate reports, as global temperatures continue to drive more intense heatwaves, wildfires, floods, and tropical storms. Yet despite the escalating intensity of extreme weather events, the relationship between climate change and human mortality is proving more complex than raw numbers suggest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new analysis by AFP, based on data from the EM-DAT global disaster database, found that more than 2.3 million people died from weather-related events between 1970 and 2025. While that figure is staggering, the death toll between 2015 and 2025 actually declined to 305,156, down from 354,428 in the previous decade.</description>

      <description>A pair of studies published this week have delivered answers to long-standing cosmic mysteries, revealing how early black holes grew to monstrous sizes and clarifying where the bright glow around supermassive black holes actually originates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers at Ireland's Maynooth University reported in Nature Astronomy on Tuesday that the chaotic conditions of the early universe allowed small black holes to undergo "feeding frenzies," growing into supermassive objects tens of thousands of times the mass of the sun in just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.</description>

      <description>Two separate teams of astronomers have announced the discovery of unusual metallic structures in space, offering rare insights into the chaotic processes shaping planetary systems and the deaths of stars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In findings announced Tuesday by the U.S. National Science Foundation's NOIRLab, researchers detected sweeping winds of vaporized metals orbiting a mystery object that dimmed a sun-like star for nearly nine months. Meanwhile, a European team revealed the presence of a massive bar-shaped cloud of iron atoms hidden inside the iconic Ring Nebula, despite centuries of observation.</description>

      <description>Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed a novel refrigeration technology that could fundamentally change how the world cools everything from food storage to artificial intelligence data centers, eliminating the need for environmentally harmful refrigerants that have long plagued the cooling industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The team, led by Prof. Li Bing from the Institute of Metal Research, published their findings in the journal Nature on January 22, detailing a new cooling mechanism called the "dissolution barocaloric effect" that achieves what had been considered impossible: combining low carbon emissions, high cooling capacity, and high heat transfer efficiency in a single system.</description>

      <description>Southeast Asia's demand for coal is growing faster than anywhere else in the world, undermining efforts to cut carbon emissions even as the region faces mounting climate change impacts, according to the International Energy Agency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regional coal consumption will rise by more than 4% annually through the end of the decade, the IEA reported in its latest coal market analysis. Indonesia, the world's largest coal exporter, will account for more than half of that growth, followed by Vietnam, which hit a record high of 65.43 million metric tonnes of coal imports in 2025.</description>

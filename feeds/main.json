      "description": "The third known interstellar object to visit our solar system continues to puzzle astronomers as it exits toward Jupiter, displaying sunward jets that defy conventional comet physics while yielding no detectable alien signals to radio telescopes scanning for signs of extraterrestrial technology.\n\nComet 3I/ATLAS, first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey in Chile, has been the subject of intense scientific scrutiny since its discovery. With the Breakthrough Listen project confirming no technosignatures were detected during five hours of observation using the Green Bank Telescope on December 18, 2025, researchers have largely settled the question of whether this cosmic wanderer might be artificial.[1][2][3]\n\n\"We all would have been thrilled to find technosignatures coming from 3I/ATLAS, but they're just not there,\" Benjamin Jacobson-Bell from the University of California, Berkeley, told Space.com. \"Finding no signals was the result we expected, due to the significant evidence for 3I/ATLAS being a comet with only natural features.\"[4]",

The move represents a stark shift in the conditions under which the 70-year-old far-right politician will serve his 27-year sentence for plotting a coup following his 2022 election defeat.[1][2][3]\n\nBolsonaro has been detained at the Federal Police Superintendency since his arrest in late November 2025, housed in a 12-square-meter room equipped with a bed, private bathroom, air conditioning, television, and desk. Under the new order, he will be relocated to a building within the Papuda complex, Brazil's largest maximum-security penitentiary facility in the capital.[4][5][6][7]",

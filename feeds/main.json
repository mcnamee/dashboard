      "description": "An international consortium of scientists has proposed a spacecraft mission to generate artificial solar eclipses in space, offering unprecedented views of the Sun's atmosphere as Earth experiences its most severe solar radiation storm in over two decades.\n\nThe Moon-Enabled Sun Occultation Mission, known as Mesom, has been submitted to the European Space Agency for consideration as a future mission. If approved, the mini-satellite would position itself within the Moon's shadow roughly once every 29.6 days, creating total eclipse conditions lasting up to 48 minutes\u2014ten times longer than typical eclipses observed from Earth.[1][2][3][4]",

Chips industry is creating jobs. The infrastructure layer is creating jobs,\" Huang said during a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. \"Jobs, jobs, jobs.\"[1][2]\n\nHuang characterized the current AI buildout as \"the largest infrastructure buildout in human history,\" predicting six-figure salaries for electricians, plumbers, and construction workers without needing \"a Ph.D. in computer science.\"[3][4]",

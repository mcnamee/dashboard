      "description": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is weighing military options in Greenland following escalating threats by US President Donald Trump to seize the Danish territory, with UK officials pursuing an urgent diplomatic strategy to defuse the most serious NATO crisis in the alliance's history.\n\nTrump declared Friday that the United States would \"do something on Greenland whether they like it or not,\" refusing to rule out military force to acquire the semi-autonomous Arctic island[1][2]. The Daily Mail reported Sunday that Trump has ordered special forces commanders to draw up invasion plans, though senior military officials are reportedly resisting the directive as unlawful[3][4].\n\nThe Telegraph reported Saturday that military planners are developing proposals for a potential NATO mission to Greenland that could involve British troops, warships and aircraft[5][6]. Downing Street has held discussions with German and French counterparts in recent days about deploying forces to demonstrate that Europe can address Arctic security concerns, according to British officials[7][5].",

Reuters could not independently verify the figures, and Iranian authorities have not released official casualty counts[1][2][3]. Some reports suggest the actual toll may be far higher, with one Tehran doctor telling TIME that at least 217 deaths had been recorded across six hospitals in the capital alone[5].\n\nMedical staff at hospitals in Tehran, Rasht, and Shiraz described facilities overwhelmed by the wounded and dead. A hospital worker in Tehran told the BBC that casualties were so numerous that \"there wasn't enough space in the morgue; the bodies were placed on top of one another\"[6][7]. Another medic reported security forces firing \"direct shots to the heads of the young people, to their hearts as well\"[6][7]. BBC Persian verified that approximately 70 bodies were brought to Poursina Hospital in Rasht on Friday night, exceeding morgue capacity[7][8].",

      "description": "Venezuela has released 18 political prisoners as of Saturday morning, following the U.S. military capture of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro one week earlier[1][2]. The prisoner releases mark the first concessions by Venezuela's interim government since U.S. forces seized Maduro in a raid on Caracas on January 3[3][4][5].\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Friday that he had canceled a planned \"second wave of attacks\" on Venezuela after the country began freeing detainees[3][6][7]. \"Venezuela is releasing large numbers of political prisoners as a sign of 'Seeking Peace,'\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, calling it \"a very important and smart gesture\"[3][8][7]. Trump said the U.S. and Venezuela \"are working well together, especially as it pertains to rebuilding, in a much bigger, better, and more modern form, their oil and gas infrastructure\"[3][7].\n\nJorge Rodr\u00edguez, president of Venezuela's National Assembly and brother of interim president Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, announced Thursday that a \"significant number\" of prisoners would be released immediately as a gesture to promote \"peaceful coexistence\"[3][5][9]. He did not specify how many would be freed or provide names[3][4][5].",

      "description": "Astronomers presented two groundbreaking discoveries this week at the 247th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Phoenix, unveiling celestial objects that challenge prevailing theories about how galaxies form and evolve.\n\nUsing NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, researchers confirmed the first-ever detection of a starless dark matter cloud dubbed Cloud-9, located 14 million light-years from Earth near the spiral galaxy Messier 94[1][2][3][4][5][6]. The object represents a category called Reionization-Limited H I Clouds, or RELHICs\u2014theoretical \"failed galaxies\" that never accumulated enough gas to ignite star formation[1][2][3][7][8][9].\n\n\"This is a tale of a failed galaxy,\" said Alejandro Benitez-Llambay, an astrophysicist at the University of Milano-Bicocca in Milan, Italy, who serves as the study's principal investigator[1][10][11]. The findings, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters in November 2025, were presented Monday at the conference[1][8][11].\n\nCloud-9's core spans roughly 4,900 light-years and contains about one million solar masses of neutral hydrogen gas[1][3][8]. Yet calculations suggest the cloud sits within a dark matter halo weighing approximately five billion solar masses\u2014mass that provides gravitational structure without producing visible light[1][3][12].\n\n\"Cloud-9 gives us a rare look at a dark-matter-dominated cloud,\" said Andrew Fox, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute for the European Space Agency[1][3][13].\n\nThe discovery began three years ago when China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope detected the hydrogen cloud during a radio survey[1][2][3][4][14][15]. Subsequent observations from the Green Bank Telescope and Very Large Array confirmed the gas presence, but only Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys could definitively rule out stars[1][3][4][8][13].\n\n\"Before we used Hubble, you could argue that this is a faint dwarf galaxy that we could not see with ground-based telescopes,\" said lead author Gagandeep Anand of the Space Telescope Science Institute[3][13][12]. \"But with Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys, we're able to nail down that there's nothing there.\"",

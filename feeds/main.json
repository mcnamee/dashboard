      "description": "President Donald Trump announced Thursday that a US military \"armada\" is heading toward Iran, even as he expressed hope that the deployment would not be needed for further military action against Tehran.\n\n\"We have an armada. We have a massive fleet heading in that direction, and maybe we won't have to use it. We'll see,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.[1][2][3]\n\nThe deployment includes the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, several guided-missile destroyers, and fighter aircraft, which began moving from the Asia-Pacific region last week, according to US officials speaking to Reuters. The carrier strike group is expected to arrive in the Middle East in the coming days, with officials also considering additional air defense systems to protect US forces and bases in the region.[4][5][6]",

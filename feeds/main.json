The confiscation campaign comes alongside military-grade jamming that has disrupted up to 80% of Starlink traffic in the country since Tehran imposed a near-total internet blackout on January 8[1][2][3].\n\nOver the weekend, authorities in western Tehran began raiding homes to confiscate Starlink equipment, according to Amir Rashidi, director of digital rights and security at the U.S.-based nonprofit Miaan Group. \"This is electronic warfare,\" Rashidi told The Wall Street Journal, noting that operations have been most severe in protest hotspots and during evening gatherings[1][4]. Iranian forces have also deployed drones to patrol rooftops searching for Starlink antennas as part of large-scale confiscation operations[2].",

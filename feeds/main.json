The finding underscores growing concerns about climate inequality as governments face mounting pressure to impose wealth taxes and restrict luxury carbon consumption.\n\nOxfam designated January 10 as \"Pollutocrat Day,\" the date when the wealthiest exceeded safe emission limits needed to keep global warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, as outlined in the Paris Agreement[1]. The analysis, using data from the Stockholm Environment Institute, found the richest 1 percent emit 75.1 tonnes of carbon dioxide per person annually, or 0.206 tonnes daily[1]. In stark contrast, someone from the poorest half of the global population would take nearly three years to use their carbon allowance[2][3].\n\nThe ultra-wealthy crossed this threshold even faster. The richest 0.1 percent depleted their annual budget by January 3, just three days into the new year[4][1].",

      "description": "Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei delivered his first public remarks on nationwide protests Friday, vowing the Islamic Republic \"will not back down\" and accusing demonstrators of acting as \"vandals\" and \"mercenaries for foreign powers.\" The defiant address came as Iran remained largely cut off from the world amid a nationwide internet and communications blackout imposed to suppress the unrest.\n\nSpeaking before supporters in Tehran on January 9, the 86-year-old cleric said protesters were destroying public property \"to please\" U.S. President Donald Trump, whose hands he claimed were \"stained with the blood of thousands of Iranians\" killed during last June's 12-day conflict between Israel, Iran, and the United States[1][2][3][4]. \"The Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of hundreds of thousands of honorable people. It will not back down in the face of vandals,\" Khamenei declared[5][1][3].",

      "description": "Iran severed internet and telephone access nationwide on January 8 as mass protests demanding an end to the Islamic Republic entered their second week, with at least 42 people killed and more than 2,200 arrested since demonstrations erupted over the country's collapsing economy[1][2][3].\n\nThe internet blackout began around 8:30 p.m. local time Thursday, just as demonstrators responded to a call by exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi for coordinated nationwide protests[4][5][6]. NetBlocks, an internet monitoring organization, confirmed connectivity had plummeted to approximately 1% of ordinary levels by Friday, effectively isolating Iran's 71.9 million internet users from the outside world[1][7][8]. \"Iran is now in the midst of a nationwide internet blackout,\" NetBlocks stated on social media platform X, adding that the shutdown \"hinders the public's right to communicate at a critical moment\"[8].\n\nThe demonstrations, which began in late December with merchants in Tehran protesting the rial's freefall to over 1.4 million per dollar, have since spread to all 31 provinces and evolved into broader calls for regime change[1][3][9]. The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported that 34 protesters and eight security personnel have died, with injuries largely caused by live ammunition, pellet shots, and plastic bullets[2][3][10].",

      "description": "Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates issued stark warnings about artificial intelligence and climate change in his annual letter released Friday, calling on governments to address risks he says market forces alone cannot solve.\n\nGates warned that \"an even greater risk than a naturally caused pandemic is that a non-government group will use open source AI tools to design a bioterrorism weapon,\" drawing parallels to his prescient 2015 TED talk about pandemic unpreparedness[1][2][3][4]. The billionaire philanthropist also highlighted job market disruption as AI's second major challenge, noting that \"we're already starting to see the impact of AI on the job market, and I think this impact will grow over the next five years\"[3][4].\n\nThe letter, titled \"Optimism with Footnotes,\" comes as President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on January 7[1][5][6]. Gates emphasized that \"without a large global carbon tax\u2014which is, unfortunately, politically unachievable\u2014market forces do not properly incentivize the creation of technologies to reduce climate-related emissions\"[2][7][8].",

The statement follows Netanyahu's late December meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, where the two leaders discussed the possibility of launching additional strikes on Iran in 2026[2][3].",

Deutsche Bank projects AI data center capital expenditure could reach $4 trillion by 2030[1][2][3], while Morgan Stanley strategist Andrew Sheets notes that \"costs are going up not down in our forecast, because there's inflation in chip costs and inflation in power costs\"[1][2][4].\n\n\"What keeps us awake at night is that inflation risk has resurfaced,\" said Julius Bendikas, European head of economics and dynamic asset allocation at Mercer, which manages $683 billion in assets[1][2]. Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management, warned that while he continues holding tech stocks for now, he \"would not be surprised to see inflation booming worldwide by the end of 2026\"[5][2].",

When pressed to clarify, he replied, \"It means we're in charge\"[1][3].\n\nThe stunning announcement came after U.S. special forces captured Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in the early morning hours of January 3 during Operation Absolute Resolve, which involved more than 150 aircraft and strikes across northern Venezuela[4][5]. Maduro is scheduled to appear in Manhattan federal court on January 5 to face narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy, and weapons charges[6][7].",

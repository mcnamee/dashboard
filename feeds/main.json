The findings, published in Nature Astronomy in December, represent a landmark measurement that settles a long-standing scientific debate over whether the shell is thin or thick.[1][2][3]\n\n\"The 18-mile estimate relates to the cold, rigid, conductive outer-layer of a pure water ice shell,\" said Steve Levin, Juno project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"If an inner, slightly warmer convective layer also exists, which is possible, the total ice shell thickness would be even greater.\"[2][3]",

      "description": "Lunai Bioworks on Tuesday announced the deployment of Sentinel, a transformer-based AI safeguard designed to prevent large language models and scientific AI systems from generating novel chemical agents. The Sacramento-based biotech company said the technology embeds directly within foundation models to screen molecular outputs in real time, functioning as what CEO David Weinstein described as \"the immune system for scientific AI.\"[1][2]\n\n\"As AI models become more powerful, safety has to move closer to the core,\" Weinstein said in a statement. \"Sentinel operates inside AI systems\u2014not outside them\u2014stopping dangerous chemical designs before they are ever produced.\"[3][1]\n\nThe launch comes amid mounting concern over the dual-use risks of advanced AI in chemistry and biology, with major AI companies including Anthropic and OpenAI warning that powerful models could assist bad actors in developing biological and chemical threats.",

Trump had threatened over the weekend to impose 100% tariffs on Canadian goods if Canada proceeds with a trade agreement with China, posting on Truth Social that Prime Minister Carney was \"gravely mistaken\" if he thought Canada could become a \"Drop Off Port\" for Chinese products.[3][4]",

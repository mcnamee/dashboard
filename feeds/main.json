Yet the mysterious visitor continues to captivate astronomers with unusual features that challenge conventional understanding of comets.\n\nOn December 18, one day before the object's closest approach to Earth, the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia scanned 3I/ATLAS across radio frequencies from 1 to 12 gigahertz[3][4][5]. The search, conducted by a team led by astronomer Ben Jacobson-Bell of the University of California, Berkeley, initially flagged 471,198 potential signals[4][6]. After filtering out interference, nine candidates remained\u2014all of which were traced to human-made radio noise on Earth[2][4].\n\n\"No artificial radio emission localized to 3I/ATLAS was detected,\" the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute confirmed[1][2][7]. The telescope was sensitive enough to detect transmitters as weak as 100 milliwatts, roughly the power of a mobile phone[8][3].",

President Donald Trump announced at a Mar-a-Lago press conference that Maduro had been \"captured and flown out of the country\" and would face drug trafficking charges in New York[1][3].",

The operation used Paveway IV guided bombs, with initial assessments indicating successful engagement of the target[1][2][8][7]. Britain's Ministry of Defence confirmed all aircraft returned safely and that the remote location was devoid of civilian habitation[1][3][8][7][9].\n\n\"This action shows our UK leadership, and determination to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies, to stamp out any resurgence of Daesh and their dangerous and violent ideologies in the Middle East,\" British Defence Secretary John Healey said, using an alternative name for ISIS[1][4][5][9].",

Parts of southern Caracas remained without electricity after strikes targeted the Fuerte Tiuna military base and La Carlota airbase[2][3], while smoke continued billowing from the Port of La Guaira to the north[1][4]. Downtown Caracas smelled of gunpowder, according to CNN reporters[5].\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, had been \"captured and flown out of the country\" following what he called a \"large-scale strike\"[6][7]. The operation, which Trump said was conducted with US law enforcement, marked the first such American military intervention in Latin America since the 1989 Panama invasion that ousted Manuel Noriega[1][3].",

The European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service reported that November 2025 saw global temperatures reach 1.54\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels[3][4].\n\n\"If we do not cease the burning of fossil fuels very quickly, it will become exceedingly difficult to achieve that warming goal,\" said Friederike Otto, co-lead of World Weather Attribution and a climate scientist at Imperial College London[1]. \"The scientific evidence is becoming increasingly unequivocal.\"",

Postdoctoral Researcher Zahra Eshaghi Gorji developed the technology in Professor Timo Repo's chemistry department laboratory, where tests revealed that one gram of the compound absorbs 156 milligrams of carbon dioxide directly from untreated air[1][4][2].\n\n\"The ease of releasing CO2 is the key advantage of the new compound,\" Eshaghi Gorji said, noting that current carbon capture compounds typically require temperatures exceeding 900 degrees Celsius to release the captured gas[1][4][2]. By contrast, the new material releases clean, recyclable CO2 at just 70 degrees Celsius within 30 minutes[1][4][2].",

      "description": "Astronomers have ignited controversy with findings suggesting dark energy could be weakening over time, potentially setting the stage for a cosmic reversal that would see the universe collapse back into itself.\n\nThe research, published in November in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, challenges decades of scientific consensus that the universe will expand forever[1][2][3]. Professor Young-Wook Lee of Yonsei University in Seoul and his team discovered what they describe as a fundamental error in how astronomers have been measuring cosmic expansion, one that has masked dramatic changes in dark energy[4][5].\n\n\"The fate of the Universe will change,\" Professor Lee told the BBC in an interview published December 27[1][6]. \"If dark energy is not constant and it's getting weakened, this will change the whole paradigm of modern cosmology.\"",

      "description": "Venezuela started shutting down oil wells in the Orinoco Belt on December 28, marking a desperate response to a US naval blockade that has left millions of barrels stranded and storage facilities at capacity[1][2][3]. The state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) plans to reduce production in the region by at least 25% to 500,000 barrels per day\u2014a 15% cut to the country's total output of 1.1 million barrels daily[1][4][5].\n\nThe production cuts represent a critical turning point for President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has attempted to maintain oil exports that form the backbone of Venezuela's economy despite mounting US pressure. PDVSA approved the emergency plan on December 23, focusing first on the Junin area's extra-heavy crude operations before moving to the Ayacucho and Carabobo regions, which produce lighter grades[1][4][5]. Disabling wells is considered a last resort due to the operational challenges and substantial costs required to restart them[1][6].",

The development, if confirmed, would mark a significant escalation in Iran's strategic posture and raise alarms in Washington and Jerusalem, particularly as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Monday to discuss Iran's missile program[4][5].\n\nThe report comes as Iran grapples with severe economic turmoil that has driven merchants and shopkeepers into the streets for a second consecutive day. On Monday, December 29, security forces fired tear gas at protesters in Tehran's Grand Bazaar and surrounding commercial districts as demonstrations intensified over soaring inflation and a currency in freefall[6][7][8].",

European markets, meanwhile, surged to record highs as Britain's FTSE 100 crossed the symbolic 10,000-point threshold for the first time[3][4].\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.7% to close at 6,845.50 points, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.8% to 23,241.99[5][6]. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.6% to 48,063.29, with 26 of its 30 components ending in negative territory[5]. The losses marked a fifth consecutive session in the red for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, ending hopes for a traditional \"Santa Claus rally\"[1][7].\n\nEarly gains were driven by semiconductor stocks, with Micron Technology jumping nearly 8% and Intel rising approximately 7%[8][9]. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index climbed 3.4% during the session[1]. However, weakness in consumer discretionary stocks, including Amazon, which fell as Tesla shares declined 1.6% after the electric vehicle maker reported annual sales fell for a second consecutive year[1][10].",

      "description": "A seven-million-year-old fossil from central Africa has provided fresh evidence that one of humanity's earliest potential ancestors walked upright, according to research published this week in Science Advances. The findings suggest that bipedalism \u2014 a defining feature of the human lineage \u2014 emerged far earlier than many scientists previously believed.\n\nThe study, led by Scott Williams, an associate professor at New York University, reexamined limb bones from *Sahelanthropus tchadensis*, a species discovered in Chad's Djurab Desert in the early 2000s. Using high-resolution 3D analysis, Williams and his team identified a small projection on the thigh bone called a femoral tubercle, which serves as the attachment point for the iliofemoral ligament[1][2][3]. Until now, this feature had been documented only in bipedal hominins.\n\n\"Our analysis of these fossils offers direct evidence that *Sahelanthropus tchadensis* could walk on two legs, demonstrating that bipedalism evolved early in our lineage and from an ancestor that looked most similar to today's chimpanzees and bonobos,\" Williams said[1][4].",

      "description": "The new year has arrived with a celestial spectacle that sets the stage for what space enthusiasts are calling one of the most ambitious years in modern space exploration. Skywatchers in the Northern Hemisphere are witnessing the Quadrantid meteor shower, coinciding with January's full Wolf supermoon, as space agencies worldwide prepare for historic lunar and planetary missions.\n\nThe Quadrantid meteor shower reached its peak between Friday, January 2, and Saturday, January 3, according to the American Meteor Society[1][2][3]. Under ideal conditions, the shower typically produces around 25 meteors per hour, with some years seeing up to 120 meteors per hour[1][4]. However, this year's viewing conditions are far from ideal. The full Wolf supermoon, which officially reached peak illumination at 5:03 a.m. EST on January 3, has washed out all but the brightest streaking meteors[5][6][7]. \"The biggest enemy of enjoying a meteor shower is the full moon,\" Mike Shanahan, planetarium director at Liberty Science Center, told the Associated Press[8].\n\nThe Quadrantids are unusual among meteor showers because they originate from an asteroid rather than a comet. Astronomers traced the shower's source to asteroid 2003 EH1, which orbits the sun every 5.5 years[9][3]. The shower is named after Quadrans Muralis, a constellation identified in 1795 that was later removed from the official list in 1922[9][10].",

The phenomenon, invisible in previous Hubble observations from 2016, occurs as NGC 4388 plunges through the intracluster medium\u2014hot wisps of gas occupying the space between galaxies in the Virgo cluster[1][2].\n\nAs the galaxy moves through this medium, pressure from the hot gas strips material from NGC 4388's disk, causing it to trail behind in a glowing tail[1]. Researchers suspect a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center provides some of the ionizing energy that causes the gas cloud to glow, while shock waves may be responsible for ionizing filaments farther out[1][3].",

China responded with a seafood import ban and restrictions on Japanese cultural products, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stating Takaichi's remarks \"gravely hurt the sentiments of the Chinese people\"[6][7].",

      "description": "China raised concerns at the United Nations about Elon Musk's rapidly expanding Starlink satellite network, warning that the unchecked proliferation of commercial satellites poses \"pronounced safety and security challenges\" in low-Earth orbit. The warning came during an informal UN Security Council meeting organized by Russia in late December.\n\nA Chinese representative told the meeting that \"the unchecked proliferation of commercial satellite constellations by a certain country, in the absence of effective regulation, has given rise to pronounced safety and security challenges,\" according to a statement from Beijing's UN mission[1][2]. The remarks came shortly after a near-collision between a Starlink satellite and a newly launched Chinese spacecraft on December 12[3][4].\n\nChina cited several incidents to support its concerns, including two occasions in 2021 when Starlink satellites came alarmingly close to China's space station, forcing astronauts to conduct evasive maneuvers[2][5]. More recently, a Starlink satellite disintegrated on December 17, producing over 100 debris fragments[2][6]. \"For spacecraft operated by developing countries lacking orbit-control capability, space situational awareness, or adequate reaction time, this undoubtedly poses a significant threat,\" the representative stated[2].",

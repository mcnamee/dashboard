The rockets reportedly struck targets 358 kilometers away in the East Sea. Kim emphasized that developing a \"reliable offensive capability and deterrence strategy\" is a key policy of the ruling Workers' Party to counter any attempts at armed conflict.[1][2][3][4]",

The findings, published in Nature Astronomy in December, represent a landmark measurement that settles a long-standing scientific debate over whether the shell is thin or thick.[1][2][3]\n\n\"The 18-mile estimate relates to the cold, rigid, conductive outer-layer of a pure water ice shell,\" said Steve Levin, Juno project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"If an inner, slightly warmer convective layer also exists, which is possible, the total ice shell thickness would be even greater.\"[2][3]",

      "description": "Tesla faces a crossroads this week as its brand value hits a three-year low and Wall Street braces for another year of declining profitability. The electric vehicle maker is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2025 earnings on Wednesday, January 28, amid mounting evidence that CEO Elon Musk's political activities and the company's aging vehicle lineup are weighing heavily on business performance.\n\nAccording to Brand Finance, Tesla's brand value fell by $15.4 billion, or 36%, in 2025, marking its third consecutive annual decline. The London-based research firm now values the Tesla brand at $27.61 billion, down from $43 billion at the start of 2025 and well below its peak of $66.2 billion in January 2023.[1][2][3]",

      "description": "Narrow bands of ocean covering just over one-third of the world's seas are responsible for absorbing nearly three-quarters of the carbon dioxide that oceans pull from the atmosphere, according to new research that reshapes scientific understanding of Earth's carbon cycle.\n\nThe study, published in Nature Climate Change, reveals that ocean fronts\u2014turbulent boundaries where different water masses collide\u2014cover 36 percent of the global ocean but account for 72 percent of total oceanic carbon dioxide uptake, absorbing approximately 1.8 billion tons of carbon annually.[1][2][3]\n\n\"This is the first time we've been able to quantify the disproportionate role that ocean fronts play in absorbing atmospheric CO2 on a global scale, and it has major implications for climate modelling,\" said lead author Dr. Kai Yang, who completed the research during his PhD at the University of Tasmania's Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) and is now a postdoctoral researcher at Xiamen University in China.[4][1]",

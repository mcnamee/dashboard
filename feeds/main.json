The finding was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday[4][5].\n\nRussia claimed on Monday that Ukraine launched 91 long-range attack drones at Putin's Valdai residence in the Novgorod region, calling it a \"terrorist attack\"[6][7][8]. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said all drones were intercepted and warned Moscow would revise its negotiating position[7][9][8].

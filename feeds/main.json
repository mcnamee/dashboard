The theoretical framework, published January 28 in Physical Review X, suggests quantum batteries could quadruple the number of qubits that fit within current cryogenic systems while reducing the infrastructure demands that have long stymied the technology's commercial progress.[1][2]\n\nQuantum computers rely on delicate quantum states to perform calculations far beyond the reach of classical machines, but sustaining those states typically requires room-sized, energy-intensive cryogenic cooling systems and complex room-temperature electronics. These constraints remain among the biggest barriers to scaling quantum computing technology.[3][4]",

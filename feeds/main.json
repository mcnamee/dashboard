      "description": "Japanese research teams are making parallel strides in quantum computing, with scientists at Institute of Science Tokyo achieving near-theoretical performance in error correction while RIKEN develops software to merge quantum computers with supercomputers.\n\nA team led by Associate Professor Kenta Kasai at Institute of Science Tokyo has developed quantum error-correction codes that approach the theoretical limit known as the hashing bound, according to research published in npj Quantum Information[1][2][3][4]. The codes achieved a frame error rate as low as 10\u207b\u2074 for systems with hundreds of thousands of qubits, with decoding complexity that scales proportionally to the number of physical qubits\u2014addressing a major barrier to practical quantum computing[1][2].\n\nTraditional quantum error-correction methods hit an accuracy ceiling far below theoretical limits, requiring heavy computation that made large-scale systems impractical[1][2]. Kasai and Master's student Daiki Komoto constructed low-density parity-check codes defined over non-binary finite fields that handle both bit-flip and phase-flip errors simultaneously[3][5]. \"Our quantum error-correcting code has a greater than 1/2 code rate, targeting hundreds of thousands of logical qubits,\" Kasai said[3][4]. The breakthrough could enable quantum computers to scale to millions of logical qubits, potentially advancing drug discovery, cryptography and climate prediction[1][6].",

However, at least one in five systems degrade at least 1.5 times faster than this typical rate, and roughly one in 12 degrade twice as fast.\"\n\nFor operators of solar farms where hundreds of thousands of panels are installed, the findings represent a hidden financial risk that challenges the economic models underpinning the industry's growth[1][2][3].",

According to researchers, extreme weather events intensified across all continents, with heatwaves becoming up to 10 times more likely than a decade ago due to climate change[3][2]. The report documented 157 severe extreme weather events that met criteria including more than 100 deaths or displacement of thousands[3].",

Postdoctoral Researcher Zahra Eshaghi Gorji developed the technology in Professor Timo Repo's chemistry department laboratory, where tests revealed that one gram of the compound absorbs 156 milligrams of carbon dioxide directly from untreated air[1][4][2].\n\n\"The ease of releasing CO2 is the key advantage of the new compound,\" Eshaghi Gorji said, noting that current carbon capture compounds typically require temperatures exceeding 900 degrees Celsius to release the captured gas[1][4][2]. By contrast, the new material releases clean, recyclable CO2 at just 70 degrees Celsius within 30 minutes[1][4][2].",

      "description": "Researchers have solved a puzzle that has been undermining electric vehicle battery performance: single-crystal lithium-ion batteries degrade through internal stresses, not the grain-boundary cracks that plague older designs. The finding, published December 23 in Nature Nanotechnology, could reshape how automakers approach battery safety and longevity[1][2][3][4].\n\nScientists at Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago discovered that design rules developed for conventional polycrystalline batteries were being incorrectly applied to newer single-crystal materials, causing unexpected performance problems[1][5][6][2][3]. \"If people don't trust batteries to be safe and long-lasting, they won't choose to use them,\" said Khalil Amine, Argonne Distinguished Fellow and co-author of the study[1][2][3][7].",

Companies including Cargill and Bunge are expected to withdraw from the 2006 pact to preserve tax benefits in Brazil's Mato Grosso state, which will strip incentives from conservation participants starting in January[3][5]. The moratorium, which bars traders from buying soybeans grown on land deforested after July 2008, is credited with curbing Amazon deforestation over nearly two decades[3][5].",

The Japanese conglomerate's CEO Masayoshi Son framed the deal as essential to AI's future, stating, \"As AI transforms industries worldwide, we need more compute, connectivity, power, and scalable infrastructure\"[1][2].\n\nThe acquisition comes one week after Alphabet, Google's parent company, announced plans to purchase data center and energy infrastructure developer Intersect for $4.75 billion in cash plus the assumption of debt[4][5][6]. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said Intersect will help the company \"expand capacity, operate more nimbly in building new power generation in lockstep with new data center load, and reimagine energy solutions to drive US innovation and leadership\"[5].",

Professor Young-Wook Lee of Yonsei University in Seoul and his team discovered what they describe as a fundamental error in how astronomers have been measuring cosmic expansion, one that has masked dramatic changes in dark energy[4][5].\n\n\"The fate of the Universe will change,\" Professor Lee told the BBC in an interview published December 27[1][6]. \"If dark energy is not constant and it's getting weakened, this will change the whole paradigm of modern cosmology.\"",

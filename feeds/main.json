      "description": "As tensions between Washington and Tehran continue to escalate amid a violent crackdown on nationwide protests, arms control experts are sounding alarms about the security of Iran's near-weapons-grade uranium stockpile, warning that months of blocked inspections have created a dangerous void in international oversight.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency has been unable to verify the status of an estimated 440.9 kilograms of uranium enriched to 60 percent purity\u2014close to the roughly 90 percent considered weapons-grade\u2014since U.S. and Israeli airstrikes struck key nuclear facilities in June 2025. That stockpile, according to IAEA standards, is theoretically enough material for 10 nuclear bombs if further enriched.[1][2][3]",

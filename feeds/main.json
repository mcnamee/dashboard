The system, published today in Nature Chemical Engineering, operates entirely outside living cells using enzymes designed to perform reactions never before seen in nature[1][2][3].\n\nThe breakthrough addresses a persistent challenge in carbon capture: converting simple one-carbon molecules into complex chemicals that can serve as raw materials for fuels, plastics and pharmaceuticals. While electrochemical processes can already reduce CO2 into formate\u2014a simple liquid compound\u2014biological systems have struggled to efficiently upgrade formate into more useful products[4][3].",

The vessel was intercepted despite not being listed among U.S.-sanctioned vessels[4]. A third tanker, the Bella 1, was being actively pursued by the Coast Guard as of Sunday[5][6].",

      "description": "Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison has moved to shore up Paramount Skydance\u2019s hostile pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery, offering an \u201cirrevocable personal guarantee\u201d of $40.4 billion in equity financing for the $108 billion all\u2011cash bid after Warner Bros.\u2019 board rejected an earlier, trust\u2011backed proposal and urged shareholders to stick with a rival deal from Netflix.[1][2][3]\n\nThe revised offer, unveiled Monday, keeps Paramount Skydance\u2019s cash price at $30 per share for 100% of Warner Bros. Discovery but converts a contentious commitment from an Ellison family trust into a direct, personal backstop from Ellison himself.[4][5][6] Paramount has also agreed to match Netflix\u2019s $5.8 billion regulatory reverse breakup fee, up from $5 billion, in an effort to narrow the perceived gap in deal certainty ahead of a key tender period for Warner Bros. Discovery investors.[7][8][9]",

      "description": "Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has affirmed that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is \"most likely natural,\" tempering months of speculation about extraterrestrial technology while simultaneously proposing an unconventional use for such cosmic visitors: delivering humanity's messages to the stars[1][2][3].\n\nIn a paper published December 21 on Medium, Loeb outlined how interstellar objects could serve as faster messengers than humanity's current efforts, dramatically reducing the time needed to send artifacts beyond our solar system[1][4]. The timing of Loeb's proposal came just two days after 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, passing within 168 million miles of our planet[5][6].\n\n\"Riding 3I/ATLAS offers the benefit of reaching interstellar space by the year ~10,000 CE instead of the year ~30,000 CE,\" Loeb wrote, comparing the comet's trajectory to NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft[1][4]. The Voyager probe, launched in 1977, travels at 17 kilometers per second and will require another 28,000 years to reach the assumed edge of the solar system, according to Loeb's calculations[1]. In contrast, 3I/ATLAS moves at 60 kilometers per second, cutting the journey time by more than two-thirds[1].",

      "description": "The NBA and world governing body FIBA will begin formally approaching European clubs and owners in January about joining a new continent-wide basketball league, with a working launch target of October 2027.[1][2][3] The project, years in the making, would create a top-tier competition backed by the NBA\u2019s commercial machine but structured around Europe\u2019s traditional promotion-and-qualification model.[1][4][5]\n\nAt the heart of the proposal is a hybrid format that combines guaranteed places for a core group of clubs with annual access via sporting merit. Current models under discussion focus on a 16-team league with 12 permanent members and four qualification spots, earned through FIBA\u2019s Basketball Champions League or a postseason tournament.[6][1][5][2] All clubs playing in FIBA-affiliated European leagues would have a theoretical path into the new competition.[6][1][5]\n\nFIBA secretary general Andreas Zagklis said the format \u201crespects European sport model principles by offering any ambitious club in the continent a fair pathway to the top,\u201d while NBA commissioner Adam Silver described the initiative as \u201can enormous opportunity\u201d to grow the professional game in Europe.[6][1][2][3]",

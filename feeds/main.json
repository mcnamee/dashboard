      "description": "A new study reveals that intensifying heat waves are overwhelming honey bees' natural ability to cool their hives, causing population declines that could threaten global pollination services. The research, published on January 12 in the journal Ecological and Evolutionary Physiology, is the first to assess how natural heat waves affect honey bee colonies' capacity to regulate temperature and maintain healthy populations.[1][2]\n\nThe findings arrive as commercial beekeepers across North America already face colony losses potentially reaching 60 to 70 percent in recent years, according to Washington State University entomologists, underscoring the urgency of understanding how climate change compounds existing threats to these critical pollinators.[3]",

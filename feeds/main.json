President Donald Trump first nominated Isaacman in December 2024, withdrew the nomination in May amid tensions with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, then renominated him in November[6][7].\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy J.

The collisions involved planetesimals\u2014rocky building blocks of planets\u2014each about 37 miles across, creating enormous dust clouds that initially masqueraded as planets[2][4].\n\n\"This is certainly the first time I've ever seen a point of light appear out of nowhere in an exoplanetary system,\" said Paul Kalas, principal investigator at the University of California, Berkeley[2][5]. \"It's absent in all of our previous Hubble images, which means that we just witnessed a violent collision between two massive objects and a huge debris cloud unlike anything in our own solar system today.\"",

      "description": "Blue Origin delayed its planned Thursday launch that would have sent the first wheelchair user into space, after high winds and technical issues forced the company to postpone the milestone mission[1][2]. The NS-37 flight, scheduled to lift off at 11:00 a.m. ET from the company's Launch Site One in West Texas, was scrubbed after the launch team observed an unspecified issue during pre-flight checks[2][3].\n\nMichaela \"Michi\" Benthaus, an aerospace and mechatronics engineer at the European Space Agency, was set to make history as the first person using a wheelchair to reach the edge of space[4][5]. The German engineer has used a wheelchair since suffering a spinal cord injury in a 2018 mountain biking accident[4][6]. \"This feels like an important step since space travel for people with disabilities is still in its very early days,\" Benthaus said in a LinkedIn post[7]. \"I'm so thankful and hope it inspires a change in mindset across the space industry, creating more opportunities for people like me.\"",

The release also features photos of billionaire Bill Gates with a woman whose face was redacted, and philosopher Noam Chomsky on a plane with Epstein[1][2][3].\n\n\"As we approach the deadline for the Epstein Files Transparency Act, these new images raise more questions about what exactly the Department of Justice has in its possession,\" said Representative Robert Garcia of California, the ranking Democrat on the committee[2]. \"We must end this White House cover-up, and the DOJ must release the Epstein files now.\"",

Even more striking was Micron's guidance for the current quarter: revenue of $18.7 billion and earnings of $8.42 per share\u2014nearly double the $4.78 analysts had expected[4][5].\n\n\"We are more than sold out,\" said Micron business chief Sumit Sadana on the earnings call, noting the company's models show \"substantial\" unmet demand as supply falls short for the foreseeable future[1][6].",

The researchers warn that this capability could make AI chatbots more manipulative, calling for immediate regulatory action to prevent misuse[1][4][5].\n\n\"It was intriguing that an LLM could so convincingly adopt human traits,\" said co-first author Gregory Serapio-Garc\u00eda from Cambridge's Psychometrics Centre. \"But it also raised important safety and ethical issues\"[1][2][3].",

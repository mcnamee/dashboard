The study introduces what researchers call the \"blue\" social cost of carbon, adding $46.2 per ton of CO2 to existing estimates, bringing the total to $97.2 per ton\u2014a 91% increase.[1][2]",

Amazon plans to invest more than \u20ac7.8 billion in the AWS European Sovereign Cloud in Germany through 2040, according to the company, with the investment expected to support an average of 2,800 full-time equivalent jobs annually and add approximately \u20ac17.2 billion to Germany's GDP.[1][2][3]",

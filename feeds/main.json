      "description": "Astronomers have discovered that the universe's most massive galaxies followed strikingly different evolutionary paths in their infancy, with some shutting down star formation early while others remained vigorously active but cloaked in dust.\n\nThe findings, presented today at the 247th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Phoenix, reveal that ultramassive galaxies containing more than 100 billion stars exhibited diverse behaviors less than 2 billion years after the Big Bang[1][2]. The research challenges assumptions that galaxy evolution proceeded uniformly in the early universe.\n\n\"What is striking is not just that we can detect hidden activity, but that we see such diversity among galaxies with similar masses at the same epoch,\" said Gillian Wilson, vice chancellor for research at UC Merced and professor of physics, who mentored the study[1]. \"That tells us that the shutdown of star formation in the most massive galaxies was neither uniform nor simple.\"",

The dispute marks the latest escalation between the two leaders after Trump's weekend military operation captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\n\"I don't believe in an invasion; I don't think it's something they take seriously,\" Sheinbaum said during her first press conference since U.S. forces seized Maduro early Saturday morning[1][2]. The Mexican leader emphasized her rejection of any U.S. military presence in her country, stating that Mexico is collaborating with Washington on security but will not accept intervention[1][2][3].",

I am not guilty. I am a decent president of my country,\" Maduro declared when 92-year-old US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein asked for his plea during the noon hearing at Manhattan federal court[1][2]. The judge then interrupted him, stating, \"A not guilty plea will be entered on behalf of Mr. Maduro.\"[1]\n\nThe couple faces charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, and possession of machine guns and destructive devices[3][1]. If convicted, they could face life imprisonment[3][4]. Maduro has retained Barry Pollack, the Washington, DC-based attorney who secured WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's release in 2024[3][5]. Flores is represented by Texas lawyer Mark Donnelly[6].",

The dollar strengthened to its highest level in two weeks while oil prices remained surprisingly stable, defying expectations of significant market turbulence.\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index climbed 0.3% to reach its strongest level since December 22, as the greenback outperformed nearly all major currencies[1][2]. The Mexican peso declined 0.7%, and the euro dropped 0.3%[2]. However, the overall market response suggested investors were treating the geopolitical shock as a contained event rather than a systemic crisis.",

The platform, comprising six integrated chips including the Rubin GPU with 336 billion transistors and 288GB of HBM4 memory, is expected to become available through partners in the second half of 2026[1][2][4].\n\n\"The timing of Rubin's launch is perfect, as the demand for AI computing, both for training and inference, is skyrocketing,\" Huang said during his keynote[2]. The announcement comes as Nvidia faces intensifying competition from rivals including Advanced Micro Devices and customers like Alphabet's Google developing their own AI chips[5].",

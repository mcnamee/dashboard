      "description": "Astronomers have ignited controversy with findings suggesting dark energy could be weakening over time, potentially setting the stage for a cosmic reversal that would see the universe collapse back into itself.\n\nThe research, published in November in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, challenges decades of scientific consensus that the universe will expand forever[1][2][3]. Professor Young-Wook Lee of Yonsei University in Seoul and his team discovered what they describe as a fundamental error in how astronomers have been measuring cosmic expansion, one that has masked dramatic changes in dark energy[4][5].\n\n\"The fate of the Universe will change,\" Professor Lee told the BBC in an interview published December 27[1][6]. \"If dark energy is not constant and it's getting weakened, this will change the whole paradigm of modern cosmology.\"",

      "description": "Venezuela started shutting down oil wells in the Orinoco Belt on December 28, marking a desperate response to a US naval blockade that has left millions of barrels stranded and storage facilities at capacity[1][2][3]. The state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) plans to reduce production in the region by at least 25% to 500,000 barrels per day\u2014a 15% cut to the country's total output of 1.1 million barrels daily[1][4][5].\n\nThe production cuts represent a critical turning point for President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has attempted to maintain oil exports that form the backbone of Venezuela's economy despite mounting US pressure. PDVSA approved the emergency plan on December 23, focusing first on the Junin area's extra-heavy crude operations before moving to the Ayacucho and Carabobo regions, which produce lighter grades[1][4][5]. Disabling wells is considered a last resort due to the operational challenges and substantial costs required to restart them[1][6].",

The development, if confirmed, would mark a significant escalation in Iran's strategic posture and raise alarms in Washington and Jerusalem, particularly as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Monday to discuss Iran's missile program[4][5].\n\nThe report comes as Iran grapples with severe economic turmoil that has driven merchants and shopkeepers into the streets for a second consecutive day. On Monday, December 29, security forces fired tear gas at protesters in Tehran's Grand Bazaar and surrounding commercial districts as demonstrations intensified over soaring inflation and a currency in freefall[6][7][8].",

Lavrov warned that Moscow would \"revise its negotiating position\" and had already determined targets for \"retaliatory strikes\"[8][5][11][9][12].\n\nThe accusation emerged just one day after Zelensky met with President Donald Trump in Florida to discuss a proposed 20-point peace plan, with both leaders claiming they had reached 90% agreement[13][14][15]. Following Russia's claim, Trump held what the White House described as a \"positive\" call with Putin, during which the Russian leader briefed the U.S. president on the alleged attack[16][17][5].",

Tesla, which delivered 1.22 million battery electric vehicles through the third quarter, is projected to reach approximately 1.65 million units for the full year, marking a 7.7% decline[2][3]. The American automaker's sales received a temporary boost in the third quarter from buyers rushing to claim a $7,500 US tax credit before it expired in September, but analysts forecast fourth-quarter sales will drop to around 449,000 units[3].",

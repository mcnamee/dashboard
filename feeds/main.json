His calls for coordinated demonstrations at 8 p.m. local time on January 8 and 9 drew large crowds to the streets of Tehran and other cities, with protesters chanting \"Long live the shah\" and \"Pahlavi will return\"[5][6][7].\n\nPahlavi has moved beyond issuing statements from exile to providing tactical guidance, urging demonstrators to \"seize and hold city centers,\" stay together on main streets, and maintain discipline[6][7]. He has also called for nationwide strikes among energy and transportation workers, seeking to apply economic pressure on the Islamic Republic[8]. Videos verified by monitoring groups showed thousands responding to his appeals despite a nationwide internet blackout imposed by authorities[5][2].",

What began as demonstrations over economic hardship has transformed into direct challenges to Iran's theocratic regime, with protesters chanting \"Death to Khamenei\" in reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei[8][9].",

A hospital worker in Tehran told the BBC that casualties were so numerous that \"there wasn't enough space in the morgue; the bodies were placed on top of one another\"[6][7]. Another medic reported security forces firing \"direct shots to the heads of the young people, to their hearts as well\"[6][7].

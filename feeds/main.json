Reuters reported that officials are weighing payments of $10,000 to $100,000 to each of Greenland's approximately 57,000 residents to encourage secession from Denmark[14][9][15], potentially totaling up to $6 billion[9][15].",

NetBlocks, an internet monitoring organization, confirmed connectivity had plummeted to approximately 1% of ordinary levels by Friday, effectively isolating Iran's 71.9 million internet users from the outside world[1][7][8]. \"Iran is now in the midst of a nationwide internet blackout,\" NetBlocks stated on social media platform X, adding that the shutdown \"hinders the public's right to communicate at a critical moment\"[8].\n\nThe demonstrations, which began in late December with merchants in Tehran protesting the rial's freefall to over 1.4 million per dollar, have since spread to all 31 provinces and evolved into broader calls for regime change[1][3][9]. The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported that 34 protesters and eight security personnel have died, with injuries largely caused by live ammunition, pellet shots, and plastic bullets[2][3][10].",

Speaking on the All-In Podcast, Lutnick said India was given \"three Fridays\" to seal the deal but proved \"uncomfortable\" arranging the call[1][2][3][4]. \"I said \u2014 You need to have Modi; it's all arranged. Modi must call the president. Yet, they were hesitant to do it,\" Lutnick said. \"Consequently, Modi did not make the call\"[1].\n\nIndia swiftly rejected the characterization. Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters Friday that the two leaders spoke eight times during 2025 and that both nations have been \"close to a deal\" on multiple occasions[1][5][6]. \"The characterization of these discussions in the reported remarks is not accurate,\" Jaiswal said, adding that India remains \"interested in a mutually beneficial trade deal\"[7][2][6].\n\nThe White House has not responded to Lutnick's comments[3][8].",

The visit represents the first US diplomatic presence in Venezuela since Maduro's capture in a military operation on January 3, 2026[7][8].",

While Motzfeldt acknowledged that the upcoming meeting would include Denmark and that Greenland still lacks authority over its own foreign policy, her remarks underscore growing tensions over how the semi-autonomous territory should navigate US pressure[1][2].",

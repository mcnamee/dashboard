      "description": "Microsoft on Monday unveiled the Maia 200, its second-generation in-house artificial intelligence chip, marking an escalation in the growing competition among tech giants to reduce their reliance on Nvidia hardware.\n\nThe new accelerator comes online this week in a data center in Iowa, with plans for deployment at a second facility in Arizona, according to Reuters. Microsoft claims the chip, designed for AI inference workloads, delivers three times the FP4 performance of Amazon's third-generation Trainium processor and Alphabet's TPU offerings.[1][2][3]",

Ran Gvili, the last remaining Israeli hostage from the October 7, 2023 attacks, has been found and identified in a Gaza cemetery, bringing a 28-month ordeal to a close and clearing the path for a contentious reopening of the Rafah border crossing.\n\nThe recovery marks the end of a chapter that began when 251 people were taken captive during Hamas's attack on southern Israel. With Gvili's return, no Israeli hostages remain in the Gaza Strip for the first time in over two years.",

      "description": "Researchers from Australia and Japan have proposed an approach to powering quantum computers using quantum batteries, a development they say could make future machines faster, more energy efficient, and easier to scale. The theoretical framework, published January 28 in Physical Review X, suggests quantum batteries could quadruple the number of qubits that fit within current cryogenic systems while reducing the infrastructure demands that have long stymied the technology's commercial progress.[1][2]\n\nQuantum computers rely on delicate quantum states to perform calculations far beyond the reach of classical machines, but sustaining those states typically requires room-sized, energy-intensive cryogenic cooling systems and complex room-temperature electronics. These constraints remain among the biggest barriers to scaling quantum computing technology.[3][4]",

      "description": "Two research teams in Asia have reported advances aimed at squeezing more electricity from solar hardware in the real world: one by cooling conventional silicon panels at their hottest failure-prone points, the other by pushing perovskite technology closer to scalable, high-efficiency modules.\n\nIn Hong Kong, researchers at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University said a hydrogel-based layer can reduce \u201chot spot\u201d temperatures on panels while raising output, a result they argue could be especially relevant for dense cities with rooftop and building-integrated solar. In South Korea, a team led by Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) reported a perovskite mini-module with 22.56% efficiency, addressing a key hurdle in making perovskites perform reliably as device area increases.[1][2][3]",

      "description": "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov announced Monday that Ukraine attempted to strike President Vladimir Putin's residence in the Novgorod region with 91 drones, vowing the attack would prompt Moscow to toughen its position in ongoing peace negotiations.\n\nThe alleged assault occurred overnight between December 28 and 29, according to Lavrov, who told Russian state news agencies TASS and Interfax that all drones were destroyed by air defenses[1][2][3]. \"Such recklessness will not go unanswered,\" Lavrov said, though he did not specify whether Putin was present at the residence during the incident[1]. Ukraine has not responded to the claims.\n\nThe announcement comes one day after U.S. President Donald Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Mar-a-Lago, where both leaders expressed cautious optimism about reaching a peace deal to end the nearly four-year war. Trump said the parties were \"getting a lot closer, maybe very close\" to an agreement, while Zelenskyy reported that a 20-point peace plan was \"90 percent agreed upon\"[4][5].",

According to Ushakov, both leaders agreed that \"the option of a temporary ceasefire proposed by the Ukrainians and the Europeans under the pretext of preparing for a referendum or under other pretexts only leads to a prolongation of the conflict and is fraught with renewed hostilities\"[1][2].",

      "description": "As the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS recedes from its closest approach to Earth last week, a contentious scientific debate has intensified over whether the mysterious visitor from beyond our solar system could be artificial technology rather than a natural object. Harvard physicist Avi Loeb continues to argue that unusual features of the comet warrant consideration of extraterrestrial origins, while NASA and mainstream astronomers maintain overwhelming evidence points to natural cometary behavior.\n\nOn December 18, the Breakthrough Listen program conducted a technosignature search of 3I/ATLAS using the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope, less than 24 hours before the object's closest approach to Earth[1][2]. The search, which scanned radio frequencies from 1 to 12 gigahertz, found no artificial signals down to a sensitivity of 100 milliwatts[2]. \"We report a nondetection of candidate signals down to the 100 mW level,\" researchers wrote in findings published this week[2].\n\nThe comet passed within approximately 168 million miles of Earth on December 19, posing no threat to our planet[3][4]. Discovered on July 1 by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile, 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object ever detected passing through our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019[3][5].",

The proposal includes NATO-style security guarantees modeled on Article 5, provisions for demilitarized zones in eastern Ukraine, and arrangements for disputed territories[12][13][14][15]. However, Trump emphasized his final authority over any agreement, telling Politico on Friday: \"He doesn't have anything until I approve it. So we'll see what he's got\"[16][4][5].",

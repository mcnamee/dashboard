      "description": "The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS completes a full rotation approximately every 7.1 hours, according to new research by Harvard astrophysicist Abraham Loeb and Italian astronomer Toni Scarmato. The findings arrive just days before a rare celestial alignment on January 22 that could provide unprecedented data about this cosmic traveler from beyond our solar system.\n\nThe study, which analyzed Hubble Space Telescope images from late 2025, used two independent methods to determine the rotation period: tracking the wobble of the comet's jet-like features and measuring brightness variations over time. The jet position angle analysis yielded a period of 7.20 \u00b1 0.05 hours, while photometric measurements produced 7.136 \u00b1 0.001 hours.[1][2][3]",

The milestone represents a concrete advancement in the company's pursuit of a container-sized fusion reactor capable of generating 10-20 MW of clean power.[1][2]\n\nThe Hod Hasharon-based startup's C3 system builds directly upon the successful experimental campaign of its predecessor, the C2-A, which achieved plasma temperatures of approximately one million degrees Celsius\u2014roughly 100 electron volts\u2014at the intended high-density regime. The new prototype incorporates design refinements across magnets, pulsed power systems, diagnostics, and overall integration, with experimental goals focused on reaching higher temperatures and extended confinement durations.[3][2][4]",

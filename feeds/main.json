Even more striking, the MSCI ACWI Ex-US index achieved its best performance since the 2009 global financial crisis, climbing approximately 30% as investors diversified away from concentrated U.S. positions[3][4]. By comparison, the S&P 500 gained 18.7% for the year, marking its third consecutive annual advance[5][6].\n\nSouth Korea's KOSPI index led all major global markets with a stunning 75.6% gain, its strongest annual performance since 1999[7][8]. The rally was powered by semiconductor manufacturers SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics, whose shares surged approximately 280% and 125% respectively on surging demand for high-bandwidth memory chips used in AI systems[7][9].\n\nLatin America emerged as an unexpected star, with Colombia's equity market skyrocketing over 91% to claim the top spot globally, according to data compiled by Morningstar for CNBC[1]. Chile, Peru, Mexico, and Brazil all posted gains exceeding 45%, establishing the region as a standout performer[1]. Analysts attributed Colombia's rally to low initial valuations, improving investor sentiment ahead of presidential elections, and a Colombian peso that appreciated nearly 15% against the dollar[1].",

As one jet brightens, the other fades in what Loeb describes as a \"clean, repeatable and geometrically consistent swap\"[4].\n\nLoeb, a Harvard astrophysicist who leads the Galileo Project, has ranked 3I/ATLAS a \"four\" on his personal scale of zero to ten, where zero represents a natural comet and ten signifies an active alien threat[5][6]. \"You can't just say, 'I know the answer' and ignore the anomalies. That's not viable,\" Loeb said[5][6].\n\n3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, is only the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019[7][8]. The object passed Earth on December 19 at a safe distance of roughly 170 million miles and is now heading toward Jupiter, where it will make its closest approach on March 16, 2026[5][9].",

Yemen's Presidential Leadership Council head, Rashad al-Alimi, subsequently cancelled a joint defense agreement with Abu Dhabi and declared a 90-day state of emergency[4][5][6].",

The operation, which CNN first reported, targeted a remote dock on Venezuela's coast that US officials believed was used by the Tren de Aragua gang to store and transport narcotics[1][2][5]. No casualties were reported as the facility was empty at the time of the strike[1][2][6].\n\nTrump initially revealed the attack during a radio interview on December 26, saying the US had destroyed a \"big facility where the ships come from\" two nights earlier, placing the strike around December 24[7][8]. When pressed by reporters about whether the CIA or military conducted the operation, Trump declined to provide details. \"I know exactly who it was, but I don't want to say who it was,\" he said at his Mar-a-Lago residence[4][9].",

The S&P 500 gained approximately 17.4% for 2025, while the Nasdaq Composite surged 21%[1][2][3]. However, these gains masked what traders called one of the most volatile years in recent memory, punctuated by President Donald Trump's tariff announcements in April that sent global markets into a tailspin[4][5].\n\nThe defining moment came April 2-3, when Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement triggered the worst two-day decline for the S&P 500 since the pandemic began, with the index teetering on the brink of a bear market[4][5]. Markets rebounded dramatically on April 9 when Trump paused many tariffs for 90 days, with the S&P 500 soaring 9.5% in a single session\u2014its largest one-day gain since October 2008[4].",

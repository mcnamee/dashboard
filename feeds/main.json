As of Friday morning, users attempting to edit images through the chatbot receive a message stating that \"image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers\"[3][4][5].\n\nThe restriction comes after governments in the UK, European Union, India, Malaysia, and France launched investigations into X and xAI, the company behind Grok, over concerns that the AI tool enabled the creation of illegal content[6][7][8][9]. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the images as \"disgraceful\" and \"disgusting,\" telling X to \"get a grip\" and pledging full government support for regulator Ofcom to take action[10][11][12].",

      "description": "As the rare interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS speeds through our solar system on its way toward Jupiter, astronomers have detected an unusual feature that has moved the scientific conversation from curiosity to genuine puzzle: the ancient comet is producing three perfectly symmetrical jets of material, separated by a strikingly consistent 120 degrees.\n\nThe phenomenon, confirmed through observations by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii between late November and late December 2025, defies standard models of how comets behave[1][2]. While most comets vent gas and dust in irregular, flickering plumes as they are heated by the sun, 3I/ATLAS has maintained this geometric precision for weeks, with each jet displaying comparable brightness and curvature[1][3].",

The attack came as Russia continued its systematic targeting of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, leaving hundreds of thousands without power, water, and heating amid freezing temperatures[1][2][3][4].\n\nThe missiles hit the city around 5 p.m. local time, damaging approximately 15 apartment buildings and nearby vehicles[5][6][7]. Among the casualties was a 77-year-old woman who died in the strike, while the wounded included children aged 7 and 16[8][9]. One man who lost a leg in the explosion remained in critical condition and underwent surgery[5][8].",

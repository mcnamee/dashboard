      "description": "As the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS recedes from its closest approach to Earth last week, a contentious scientific debate has intensified over whether the mysterious visitor from beyond our solar system could be artificial technology rather than a natural object. Harvard physicist Avi Loeb continues to argue that unusual features of the comet warrant consideration of extraterrestrial origins, while NASA and mainstream astronomers maintain overwhelming evidence points to natural cometary behavior.\n\nOn December 18, the Breakthrough Listen program conducted a technosignature search of 3I/ATLAS using the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope, less than 24 hours before the object's closest approach to Earth[1][2]. The search, which scanned radio frequencies from 1 to 12 gigahertz, found no artificial signals down to a sensitivity of 100 milliwatts[2]. \"We report a nondetection of candidate signals down to the 100 mW level,\" researchers wrote in findings published this week[2].\n\nThe comet passed within approximately 168 million miles of Earth on December 19, posing no threat to our planet[3][4]. Discovered on July 1 by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile, 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object ever detected passing through our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019[3][5].",

      "description": "The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which passed Earth last week at a distance of 167 million miles, continues to generate controversy as scientists and lawmakers press NASA for greater transparency about the third confirmed visitor from beyond our solar system[1][2]. The rare cosmic object has exhibited unpredictable trajectory changes and unusual features that challenge standard comet models, intensifying calls for the release of raw observational data[3][4].\n\nIn late December, astronomers observed that 3I/ATLAS had deviated from its predicted path due to non-gravitational acceleration\u2014forces not accounted for by gravity alone[3][5]. According to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, the comet experienced a \"radial acceleration away from the Sun of 1.1x10^{-6} au per day squared,\" which would require the object to have shed approximately 13 percent of its total mass during its October perihelion passage[5][6]. However, such a massive gas cloud has not been detected, leaving the acceleration mechanism unexplained[7].",

      "description": "Turkish ports have become a critical transit hub for Russian oil products reaching the European Union, even as Brussels moves to eliminate Russian energy imports by late 2027, multiple investigations and recent reports reveal.\n\nTankers routinely discharge thousands of barrels from Russia at storage facilities in Turkish port cities including Mersin, Ceyhan, and Marmara Ere\u011flisi before reshipping similar volumes to EU destinations[1][2][3]. Since the EU's petroleum products ban took effect in February 2023 through early 2024, Europe imported \u20ac3.1 billion worth of oil products from three Turkish ports with no refining facilities, while 86% of those ports' imports came from Russia during the same period, according to research by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air[2][4][3].\n\nThe findings underscore the challenge Europe faces in severing energy ties with Moscow despite ambitious targets. On December 3, EU lawmakers reached a deal to ban all Russian gas imports by autumn 2027, marking what European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called \"the dawn of a new era, the era of Europe's full energy independence from Russia\"[5][6][7][8]. The agreement prohibits Russian liquefied natural gas by end of 2026 and pipeline gas by September 2027[5][9].",

The joint statement calls for \"an immediate ceasefire...involving all types of weapons, including attacks on civilians, civilian objects and infrastructures\"[1][2].\n\nThe accord ends 20 days of fighting that has killed at least 101 people and displaced more than 500,000 on both sides[3][4].

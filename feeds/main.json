      "description": "As the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS recedes from its closest approach to Earth last week, a contentious scientific debate has intensified over whether the mysterious visitor from beyond our solar system could be artificial technology rather than a natural object. Harvard physicist Avi Loeb continues to argue that unusual features of the comet warrant consideration of extraterrestrial origins, while NASA and mainstream astronomers maintain overwhelming evidence points to natural cometary behavior.\n\nOn December 18, the Breakthrough Listen program conducted a technosignature search of 3I/ATLAS using the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope, less than 24 hours before the object's closest approach to Earth[1][2]. The search, which scanned radio frequencies from 1 to 12 gigahertz, found no artificial signals down to a sensitivity of 100 milliwatts[2]. \"We report a nondetection of candidate signals down to the 100 mW level,\" researchers wrote in findings published this week[2].\n\nThe comet passed within approximately 168 million miles of Earth on December 19, posing no threat to our planet[3][4]. Discovered on July 1 by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile, 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object ever detected passing through our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019[3][5].",

The proposal includes NATO-style security guarantees modeled on Article 5, provisions for demilitarized zones in eastern Ukraine, and arrangements for disputed territories[12][13][14][15].

While a full collapse is unlikely to occur in the next few decades, the glacier \"is set to retreat further, and faster, through the 21st and 22nd centuries,\" potentially leading to a general collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet by the 23rd century[1][2].",

The meeting, set for Sunday afternoon, is part of ongoing efforts to advance a 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the nearly four-year conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe White House confirmed that Trump and Zelensky would meet at 3 p.m. local time in Palm Beach[5][6]. Zelensky arrived in the United States after stopping in Halifax, where Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney pledged an additional $2.5 billion in economic assistance for Ukraine[7][8][9]. The aid package includes loan guarantees to the World Bank and financing that will enable the International Monetary Fund to lend an additional $8.4 billion to Ukraine[10].",

      "description": "Turkish ports have become a critical transit hub for Russian oil products reaching the European Union, even as Brussels moves to eliminate Russian energy imports by late 2027, multiple investigations and recent reports reveal.\n\nTankers routinely discharge thousands of barrels from Russia at storage facilities in Turkish port cities including Mersin, Ceyhan, and Marmara Ere\u011flisi before reshipping similar volumes to EU destinations[1][2][3]. Since the EU's petroleum products ban took effect in February 2023 through early 2024, Europe imported \u20ac3.1 billion worth of oil products from three Turkish ports with no refining facilities, while 86% of those ports' imports came from Russia during the same period, according to research by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air[2][4][3].\n\nThe findings underscore the challenge Europe faces in severing energy ties with Moscow despite ambitious targets. On December 3, EU lawmakers reached a deal to ban all Russian gas imports by autumn 2027, marking what European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called \"the dawn of a new era, the era of Europe's full energy independence from Russia\"[5][6][7][8]. The agreement prohibits Russian liquefied natural gas by end of 2026 and pipeline gas by September 2027[5][9].",

The assault damaged residential buildings across seven districts and sparked multiple fires, forcing emergency evacuations from a university dormitory and a nursing home[5][2].\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported that approximately one-third of the city's more than 3 million residents lost heat as temperatures hovered near freezing[6][3][7]. \"Almost a third of the capital is now without heat supply. There is no electricity in some areas of the left bank,\" Klitschko stated on Telegram[7]. DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company, implemented emergency power cuts across Kyiv and surrounding regions following instructions from national grid operator Ukrenergo[1][8].",

The researchers based their findings on satellite imagery from Planet Labs showing hurried construction that began in August[2][3].\n\n\"One dead giveaway in a November 19 photo is a military-grade rail transfer point enclosed by a security fence to which missiles, their mobile launchers and other components could be delivered by train,\" Eveleth said[2]. The imagery also revealed a concrete pad at the end of the runway that was covered with earth, consistent with a camouflaged launch point[2][3].",

      "description": "The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, continues to challenge scientists' understanding of comet physics as it departs the solar system[1][2][3]. The object displays an unusual \"anti-tail\" pointing toward the Sun and containing particles far larger than typical cometary dust, behaviors that have prompted researchers to reexamine existing models of how comets form and evolve[4][2][5].\n\nAstronomers using the Two-meter Twin Telescope at Teide Observatory in Tenerife detected wobbling jets within the anti-tail during an intensive 37-night observation campaign between July and September 2025[1][6]. This periodic motion allowed researchers to calculate that 3I/ATLAS's nucleus rotates once every 14 to 17 hours, marking the first time scientists have directly measured the rotation period of an interstellar comet from its surface activity[1][6].",

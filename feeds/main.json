Nearly 40 international researchers are now racing against time to complete fieldwork that could reveal how quickly this Florida-sized glacier might contribute to global sea-level rise[1][2][3].\n\nThe 12-day voyage from New Zealand proceeded smoothly until Monday evening, when the vessel encountered an unexpectedly dense barrier of sea ice surrounding the Antarctic continent[1][4][1]. For hours, Captain Kim Gwang-heon and his crew maneuvered the 360-foot icebreaker through the frozen landscape, frequently reversing course when passages became blocked[1][3][1]. The ship groaned and shook as it collided with ice formations, creating sounds that resembled \"being inside a washing machine,\" according to The New York Times[1][1]. Captain Kim, who remained awake for more than 30 hours navigating the treacherous conditions, expressed relief when the thickest ice finally dissipated around midnight Wednesday[1][5][1]. \"We all possible for predicting conditions, it doesn't always go as planned,\" he said[1][1].",

Five years ago, a catastrophic drought turned his fertile land to dust, killing thousands of native kangaroos and forcing him to reconsider the future of his century-old family farm. Today, those same fields host part of the massive MacIntyre Wind Farm, generating power for 700,000 homes\u2014and providing Finlay with crucial supplemental income as agriculture grows increasingly unpredictable[1][2].\n\nHis story reflects a broader economic shift gaining momentum worldwide. As renewable energy costs continue their precipitous decline, a rapid transition away from fossil fuels has emerged as not just an environmental imperative, but an enormous economic opportunity. According to a University of Oxford study, transitioning to renewable energy by 2050 could save the global economy at least $12 trillion in energy system costs compared to maintaining current fossil fuel use[3][4][5].",

      "description": "The European Commission announced measures Wednesday to temporarily suspend tariffs and carbon levies on fertiliser imports following pressure from France and Italy to ease costs for struggling farmers.\n\nEU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic told agriculture ministers at a meeting in Brussels that the Commission will propose to temporarily suspend remaining most favored nation tariffs on ammonia, urea and other fertilisers[1][2]. The tariffs currently stand at 6.5% for ammonia and 5.5% for urea[1]. Additionally, the Commission will issue guidance allowing temporary suspension of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism on fertilisers, retroactive to January 1, 2026[3][4][5].\n\n\"Keeping fertilisers affordable is vital for farmers' incomes and Europe's food security,\" Sefcovic said at a press conference[1]. \"While prices have stabilised, fertiliser costs remain around 60% higher than in 2020 and that is simply not sustainable.\"[1]",

French President Emmanuel Macron announced that Paris could deploy \"several thousand\" troops to monitor the Russia-Ukraine border and help regenerate Ukrainian armed forces, emphasizing these would not be combat forces[7][8][9].\n\nThe summit marked the first time the United States directly backed the coalition's security framework, with US envoy Steve Witkoff declaring that President Donald Trump \"strongly, strongly stands behind security protocols\"[2][10][11]. The American delegation, which included Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, reported \"significant progress on several critical workstreams, including our bilateral security guarantee framework\"[1][12][13].",

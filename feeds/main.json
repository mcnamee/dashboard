      "description": "Engineers at the University of Leicester have unveiled a design framework for magnetic cloaking devices that can shield electronics from disruptive magnetic fields, marking the first practical approach for objects of any shape. The research, published December 18 in Science Advances, offers potential applications from medical imaging to fusion energy[1][2][3].\n\nLed by Dr. Harold Ruiz from Leicester's School of Engineering, the team developed a physics-informed optimization framework that solves Maxwell's equations to design magnetic cloaks for arbitrarily shaped structures[1][2]. Previous magnetic cloaking demonstrations were restricted to simple cylinders or spheres, limiting real-world applicability[1][2][3].\n\nThe devices work by manipulating magnetic field lines to flow around objects as if they weren't there, making the cloaked object magnetically invisible while leaving surrounding fields undisturbed[2][3]. The design combines two materials with opposing magnetic properties: an inner superconducting layer that repels magnetic fields and an outer soft ferromagnetic layer that attracts them, creating a balanced effect that eliminates field distortion[1][2][3].",

The deal aims to strengthen energy reliability, reduce costs, and accelerate decarbonization efforts in both regions[3][4].",

The move came three days after White House budget director Russell Vought announced the administration would dismantle NCAR, calling it \"one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country\"[3][4].\n\n\"President Trump is attacking Colorado because we refuse to bend to his corrupt administration,\" the senators said in a joint statement[1]. \"We are holding the Senate's appropriations package to demand full funding for NCAR.\"\n\nThe standoff left lawmakers scrambling as they face a January 30 funding deadline[2]. Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins told reporters Thursday evening that only one hold remained on the package after weeks of negotiations with fiscal conservatives, identifying the Colorado senators as the final obstacle[2][5].",

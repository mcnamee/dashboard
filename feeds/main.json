According to Israel's public broadcaster KAN News, the hacked broadcast aired around 9:30 p.m. local time.[1][2]",

Initially conceived to oversee governance and reconstruction in post-war Gaza, the board's draft charter indicates aspirations for a broader mandate addressing global conflicts.[3][4][5][6]",

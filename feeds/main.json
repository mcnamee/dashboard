      "description": "President Donald Trump announced Saturday that the United States would temporarily \"run\" Venezuela following the capture of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in a dramatic overnight military operation, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared to soften that stance on Sunday, suggesting Washington would use oil leverage rather than govern the country directly[1][2].\n\nMaduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were seized from their home in Caracas early Saturday during a raid by U.S. special forces and transported to New York, where they are being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn ahead of a Monday court appearance on narco-terrorism charges[3][4]. Trump told reporters the U.S. would \"run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\"[3][1].\n\nYet on Sunday morning talk shows, Rubio walked back those assertions. \"People keep fixating on that,\" he told NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" clarifying that the U.S. would continue enforcing an oil quarantine to press for policy changes rather than governing Venezuela day-to-day[1][2]. \"We expect to see changes in Venezuela,\" Rubio said, adding the U.S. would use control of sanctioned oil as \"tremendous leverage\"[2].",

The renewed pressure on Denmark came just hours after a controversial U.S. military operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, sparking fears among European allies that Trump's expansionist rhetoric could extend to the Arctic territory.\n\nThe timing amplified diplomatic tensions when Katie Miller, wife of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, posted an image of Greenland draped in the American flag on social media late Saturday with a single word: \"SOON\"[3][4][5]. Denmark's ambassador to the United States, Jesper Moeller Soerensen, responded swiftly, declaring his country expects \"full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark\"[3][4].",

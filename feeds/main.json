      "description": "Diplomatic and economic frictions between China and Japan intensified Friday as Beijing rejected Tokyo's appeals to lift export restrictions while Japanese officials confirmed widespread delays in agricultural shipments at Chinese customs, capping a week of mounting tensions between Asia's two largest economies.\n\nChinese Ambassador Wu Jianghao dismissed a Japanese Foreign Ministry petition Thursday to retract newly imposed export controls on dual-use items\u2014products and technologies serving both civilian and military purposes\u2014according to the Chinese embassy in Japan[1][2]. The restrictions, which China's Ministry of Commerce announced January 6 and implemented immediately, prohibit exports to Japan for military use or any purpose that could enhance Japanese military capabilities[3][4][5].\n\nThe measures came in direct response to comments by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who suggested in November that Japan could intervene militarily if China used force against self-governed Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory[3][1][6]. Wu called China's actions \"entirely legitimate, reasonable and lawful\" and vital to national security[1][2].",

For battery products, the rebate rate will be reduced from 9% to 6% between April 1 and December 31, 2026, then eliminated entirely on January 1, 2027[1][2][3]. The announcement was made public on January 9, 2026, according to The Hindu BusinessLine[1].\n\nThe policy shift follows a previous reduction in December 2024, when the rebate rate for solar and battery products dropped from 13% to 9%[4][5]. China's dominant manufacturers\u2014including JinkoSolar, LONGi, Trina Solar, and battery giants CATL and BYD\u2014face increased export costs as the rebates disappear[6][7].",

      "description": "Nearly four years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the combined military toll of the conflict is approaching two million casualties, according to a study released Tuesday by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nThe Washington-based think tank estimates approximately 1.2 million Russian troops and close to 600,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed, wounded, or gone missing since February 2022, bringing the current total to roughly 1.8 million. By this spring, the study projects, that figure will reach two million if current trends continue.[1][2]",

      "description": "Colombian President Gustavo Petro said Tuesday that ousted Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro should be returned to face trial in his home country rather than in the United States, adding a new layer of complexity to regional tensions one week before his scheduled meeting with President Donald Trump.\n\n\"They have to return him and have him tried by a Venezuelan court, not a US one,\" Petro said Tuesday, according to Bloomberg. The statement marks the Colombian leader's most direct intervention yet in the diplomatic standoff over Maduro's fate since US forces captured the former Venezuelan president in a dramatic pre-dawn raid on January 3.[1]",

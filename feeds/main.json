The study introduces what researchers call the \"blue\" social cost of carbon, adding $46.2 per ton of CO2 to existing estimates, bringing the total to $97.2 per ton\u2014a 91% increase.[1][2]",

      "description": "Wildfires scorching the Arctic have reached levels unseen in 3,000 years, as rising temperatures transform the frozen north into an increasingly flammable landscape, according to a new NASA report and recent scientific studies.\n\nThe number of wildland fires burning in the Arctic is on the rise, with blazes burning larger, hotter, and longer than in previous decades, researchers say. The burned area in the North American Arctic has roughly doubled compared to the mid-20th century, and the mid-2010s ushered in what scientists describe as a novel fire regime.[1][2][3]\n\n\"Fire has always been a part of boreal and Arctic landscapes, but now it's starting to act in more extreme ways that mimic what we've seen in the temperate and the tropical areas,\" said Jessica McCarty, Deputy Earth Science Division Chief at NASA's Ames Research Center and lead author of a 2025 Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme report.[4][1]",

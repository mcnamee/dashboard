The revelation comes as the interstellar visitor approaches a close pass with Jupiter in mid-March that researchers say could expose new secrets about its composition and structure.\n\nAccording to newly confirmed analyses, 3I/ATLAS appeared in data collected by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) between May 7 and June 2, 2025\u201455 days before the ATLAS telescope in Chile flagged the object as a potential interstellar visitor. The comet remained effectively invisible in those earlier recordings until scientists revisited the data with updated parameters and image-stacking techniques, coadding more than 9,000 individual frames to reconstruct a faint but consistent signal matching the object's trajectory.[1][2][3]",

The benchmark represents a global collaboration of nearly 1,000 professors and researchers from over 500 institutions across 50 countries, including contributors from KAIST and Yonsei University in South Korea.[1][2]",

The decree did not specify tariff rates or which countries would be affected.[1][2][3][4]",

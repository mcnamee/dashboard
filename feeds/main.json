Meanwhile, separate findings presented at the 247th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Phoenix show galaxy clusters far hotter than predicted and objects so strange that scientists are comparing them to the platypus.[1][2][3]",

      "description": "For more than seven decades, the Hall-Petch effect has guided engineers in strengthening metals: make the grains smaller, and the metal gets harder. But a new study from Cornell University has upended that foundational principle, revealing that at extreme speeds, smaller-grained metals actually become weaker.\n\nThe research, published January 12, 2026 in Physical Review Letters, found that when copper is deformed at supersonic velocities, the long-held relationship between grain size and strength reverses entirely[1][2].",

The conversation came days after President Donald Trump threatened to launch ground operations against Mexican cartels, remarks that have heightened tensions between the neighboring nations.[1][2]\n\nThe call was initiated at the instruction of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who on Friday directed de la Fuente to engage with U.S. officials to \"strengthen coordination\" under the existing bilateral security agreement.[3][4]",

The timing for a potential listing remains unclear, and the process is still in its nascent stages. Alibaba's American depositary receipts rose over 4.6% in pre-market U.S. trading following the news.[4][5][2][6][1]",

      "description": "The last three years have been the hottest since the pre-industrial era, according to annual climate reports, as global temperatures continue to drive more intense heatwaves, wildfires, floods, and tropical storms. Yet despite the escalating intensity of extreme weather events, the relationship between climate change and human mortality is proving more complex than raw numbers suggest.\n\nA new analysis by AFP, based on data from the EM-DAT global disaster database, found that more than 2.3 million people died from weather-related events between 1970 and 2025. While that figure is staggering, the death toll between 2015 and 2025 actually declined to 305,156, down from 354,428 in the previous decade.[1][2][3]",

It has stopped, it's stopping, and there's no plan for executions or an execution or executions,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on January 14. The president attributed the information to \"very important sources on the other side,\" though he acknowledged uncertainty, adding, \"I hope it's true. Who knows, right?\"[1][2]",

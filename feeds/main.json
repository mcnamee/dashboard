Yet despite the escalating intensity of extreme weather events, the relationship between climate change and human mortality is proving more complex than raw numbers suggest.\n\nA new analysis by AFP, based on data from the EM-DAT global disaster database, found that more than 2.3 million people died from weather-related events between 1970 and 2025. While that figure is staggering, the death toll between 2015 and 2025 actually declined to 305,156, down from 354,428 in the previous decade.[1][2][3]",

But that will not make this case go away,\" Rasmussen said following a meeting of the Foreign Policy Committee in Copenhagen, according to public broadcaster TV2.[1]",

The plan, which had been coordinated with Ukrainian and European partners, was delivered informally to give the Kremlin time to review the proposal and prepare feedback before expected high-level talks.[1][2]\n\nThe diplomatic maneuver comes as U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed Wednesday that he and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law, will travel to Moscow on Thursday to meet with Putin. \"The Russians are the ones requesting this meeting. I believe this is a noteworthy indication on their part,\" Witkoff said at the World Economic Forum in Davos.[3][4][5][6]",

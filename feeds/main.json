The research team, led by Bet\u00fcl Ka\u00e7ar, a professor of bacteriology, and Holly Rucker, a PhD candidate in Ka\u00e7ar's lab, focused on nitrogenase, an enzyme essential for converting atmospheric nitrogen into a form usable by living organisms.[1][2]\n\n\"We picked an enzyme that really set the tone of life on this planet and then interrogated its history,\" Ka\u00e7ar says. \"Without nitrogenase, there would be no life as we know it.\"[3][1]",

However, a sale is not guaranteed, and Shell could still choose to retain the assets. The company declined to comment.[2][3][1]",

The AI chipmaker gained 30% in 2025, while Palantir soared 140%[1].

But the benefits depend on whether states choose to adopt parallel deductions\u2014a decision that could cost state budgets hundreds of millions of dollars annually while already facing increased costs from federal Medicaid and food assistance mandates[1][3].",

The SBU's Alpha unit used aerial drones to strike the QENDIL tanker more than 2,000 kilometers from Ukraine, according to sources within the intelligence agency[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8].\n\nThe tanker was empty at the time of the attack and sustained critical damage, rendering it unable to be used for its intended purpose, an SBU source told news outlets[1][2][4][5]. The operation represents an unprecedented expansion of Ukraine's reach against Russian economic targets, demonstrating Kyiv's growing capability to strike Russian assets far beyond the immediate conflict zone.",

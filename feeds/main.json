With the Breakthrough Listen project confirming no technosignatures were detected during five hours of observation using the Green Bank Telescope on December 18, 2025, researchers have largely settled the question of whether this cosmic wanderer might be artificial.[1][2][3]\n\n\"We all would have been thrilled to find technosignatures coming from 3I/ATLAS, but they're just not there,\" Benjamin Jacobson-Bell from the University of California, Berkeley, told Space.com. \"Finding no signals was the result we expected, due to the significant evidence for 3I/ATLAS being a comet with only natural features.\"[4]",

The Italian think tank indicated that Khamenei had consistently blocked the final decision to escalate to 90 percent weapons-grade enrichment and initiate miniaturized warhead creation, despite pressure from the Revolutionary Guards[2][3].\n\nISPI's analysis suggests the June conflict fundamentally altered Iran's strategic calculus. The 12-day war, which ran from June 13-24, revealed Iran's air defense systems were largely ineffective, with only medium-range missile capabilities proving reliable[2][3][4]. Tehran may have concluded that nuclear weapons would serve as its only viable deterrent against Israel and the United States, the report stated[2][3].",

      "description": "China capped a banner year in space with 89 orbital launches through December 23, shattering its previous annual record and marking significant advances in reusable rocket technology and deep-space exploration[1][2][3].\n\nThe nation's latest milestone came Monday when its Long March 12A reusable rocket successfully reached orbit but failed to recover its first stage during a landing attempt at Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center[2][3]. The test followed a similar December 3 attempt by commercial firm LandSpace, whose Zhuque-3 rocket reached orbit but crashed during its landing burn[4][5][6].\n\nChina's 2025 launch total far exceeded the 68 missions flown in 2024[4][7][8]. According to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, the country placed 322 satellites in orbit through November 30, a 22 percent increase over the previous year[4]. The surge was driven largely by deployments for two megaconstellations\u2014the government-backed Guowang and Shanghai's Qianfan\u2014each designed to exceed 10,000 satellites to compete with SpaceX's Starlink network[9][10][11].",

Reuters first reported that Nvidia recently tested Intel's so-called 18A process but stopped moving forward, citing two unidentified sources familiar with the matter[4][5][6]. Broadcom also conducted similar testing, the report said[2][7].\n\nAn Intel spokesperson told Reuters the company's 18A manufacturing technologies are \"progressing well\" and that it \"continues to see strong interest\" for its next-generation production process[6][8]. Neither Nvidia nor Broadcom representatives responded to requests for comment from Reuters[9][5].",

      "description": "International space agencies are gearing up for an intensive year of lunar and interplanetary exploration, with NASA, China, India, and Europe planning historic missions that could reshape human understanding of the solar system.\n\nNASA's Artemis II mission leads the charge, targeting a launch as early as February 5, 2026, according to agency officials[1][2]. The 10-day lunar flyby will carry four astronauts\u2014Commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, mission specialist Christina Koch, and Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen\u2014marking humanity's first crewed journey beyond low Earth orbit since Apollo 17 in 1972[3][4]. The crew has named their Orion spacecraft \"Integrity\"[5][6].\n\nChina plans to launch Chang'e 7 to the Moon's south pole in August 2026, where the mission will search for water ice deposits using an innovative \"hopping\" probe equipped with a water molecule analyzer[7][8]. The spacecraft will include an orbiter, lander, rover, and flying probe, spending up to two months examining permanently shadowed craters near Shackleton crater[7][9]. China also expects to launch its Xuntian space telescope by late December 2026, a facility with a field of view 300 times larger than Hubble's that will co-orbit with the Tiangong space station[10][11].\n\nIndia's space agency ISRO aims to conduct its first uncrewed Gaganyaan test flight by March 2026, carrying Vyommitra, a humanoid test robot[12][13]. The mission will validate critical systems for India's planned 2027 crewed spaceflight, making India potentially the fourth nation to independently launch astronauts[12][14]. ISRO Chairman V. Narayanan confirmed that 90% of Gaganyaan's development work has been completed, with human-rated launch vehicles and life support systems nearing completion[15].",

The attack left consumers in Odesa, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, and Chernihiv without electricity, according to Ukraine's Ministry of Energy[1][2].\n\nEmergency blackouts were imposed in Kyiv and the surrounding region, as well as in Odesa, Kharkiv, and Donetsk oblasts. Authorities said a gradual transition from emergency restrictions to scheduled hourly shutdowns was underway in the capital[1].\n\nThe overnight assault extends a devastating week of Russian strikes targeting Ukraine's power grid. Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said not a single day had passed this week without attacks on energy facilities, with 44 strikes recorded in total[3][4].",

      "description": "Venezuela's interim government announced on Monday the release of 116 political prisoners, though human rights organizations have only been able to verify roughly half that number. The releases come after U.S. pressure following the capture of former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by American forces earlier this month.\n\nThe discrepancy highlights ongoing tensions between the interim government's claims and the reality on the ground. The Penitentiary Services Ministry stated that those freed had been \"deprived of their liberty for acts associated with disrupting the constitutional order and undermining the stability of the nation.\"[1][2] However, the human rights group Foro Penal reported that only 41 prisoners had been released as of Monday, including 24 freed overnight.[3][4] Another watchdog, Justicia, Encuentro y Perd\u00f3n, confirmed 53 \"duly verifiable\" releases and called the current pace \"clearly inadequate.\"[5][6]",

      "description": "The White House is considering Iran's proposal to enter nuclear negotiations even as President Donald Trump leans toward authorizing military strikes against the Islamic Republic, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter[1][2].\n\nTrump announced Sunday that Iran had reached out to the United States the previous day proposing to negotiate a nuclear agreement[2][3]. \"Iran reached out because they want to talk,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One[3]. The President indicated his administration was working to arrange a meeting with Tehran but warned he might need to take action beforehand as the death toll from protests continues to rise[3].\n\nThe overture arrives amid a brutal crackdown on nationwide demonstrations that erupted December 28 following the Iranian rial's collapse to a record low of 1.4 million to the dollar[4][5][6]. At least 538 people have been killed in the two-week uprising, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which has a history of accuracy during previous unrest in Iran[4][7]. More than 10,600 individuals have been arrested[7].",

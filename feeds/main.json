      "description": "Hundreds of previously undetected earthquakes are rattling Antarctica's Thwaites Glacier, while an international team of scientists aboard a Korean icebreaker struggles against harsh weather to drill into the massive ice sheet that could reshape the world's coastlines if it collapses.\n\nA study published in Geophysical Research Letters by seismologist Thanh-Son Ph\u1ea1m of the Australian National University detected 362 glacial earthquakes in West Antarctica between 2010 and 2023, with 245 of them occurring at Thwaites\u2014nicknamed the \"Doomsday Glacier\" because its collapse could trigger catastrophic sea level rise. The earthquakes, caused by massive icebergs capsizing as they calve from the glacier, were largely missed by global seismic networks due to their low-frequency waves.[1][2][3][4]\n\n\"It is a lot less stable and has been hit by hundreds of iceberg earthquakes,\" Ph\u1ea1m told Gizmodo, noting that the most prolific period of seismic activity between 2018 and 2020 coincided with an accelerated flow of the glacier's ice tongue toward the sea.[4][1]",

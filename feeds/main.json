We discussed some ideas that might help,\" Zelenskiy said following a meeting with more than 30 allies in the French capital[1][2]. White House special envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed that land options were discussed during the talks and that consultations would continue[1].\n\nThe territorial question centers on the eastern Donetsk region, where Russia is demanding Ukraine surrender remaining areas under its control. Ukraine previously said the US proposed creating a \"free economic zone\" if Kyiv withdraws from parts of Donetsk still held by Ukrainian forces[1][3]. The proposal would establish a demilitarized area, though uncertainty remains over who would govern the territory[3]",

The six-chip system, which includes the Rubin GPU and new Vera CPU, delivers up to five times more AI training power than the current Blackwell architecture while reducing inference token costs by roughly one-tenth, according to Nvidia[3][6][8].\n\nHuang also unveiled Alpamayo, an open-source family of AI models designed specifically for autonomous vehicles[9][10]. The system uses chain-of-thought reasoning to help self-driving cars navigate complex scenarios and explain their decisions. Mercedes-Benz plans to integrate Alpamayo into its upcoming CLA model, set to arrive at U.S. dealerships in the first quarter of 2026[11]",

The search, which included the most sensitive radio observations ever conducted on an interstellar object, ruled out any continuous radio transmitters stronger than approximately 0.1 watts at the comet's location[1][3][4].\n\nThe 100-meter Green Bank Telescope observed 3I/ATLAS on December 18, 2025, one day before its closest approach to Earth[5][1][6]. Initial scans flagged roughly 470,000 candidate signals, but all were eventually traced to human-made radio interference[2][4]. \"In the end, there were no surprises,\" lead researcher Benjamin Jacobson-Bell told Space.com[5]. Similar searches using the Allen Telescope Array, MeerKAT in South Africa, and other facilities worldwide reached the same conclusion[1][6]",

      "description": "The world's largest technology showcase opened its doors in Las Vegas on Monday with a decisive pivot toward \"physical AI\"\u2014systems that move, navigate, and operate in real-world environments rather than just processing data on screens. Chipmakers Nvidia, AMD, and Intel unveiled next-generation processors designed to power this shift, while robot manufacturers demonstrated machines that can finally tackle one of home automation's last frontiers: climbing stairs.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang kicked off the show by announcing the Vera Rubin platform, a next-generation AI superchip architecture now in full production that the company claims offers more than triple the speed of its current Blackwell chips[1][2]. The platform, named after astronomer Vera Rubin, combines six chips into what Nvidia calls \"one AI supercomputer,\" with products expected to roll out from partners in the second half of 2026[2][3].\n\n\"The moment for physical AI has arrived\u2014when machines start to comprehend, reason, and operate in the real world,\" Huang said during his keynote[4]. He also unveiled Alpamayo, an AI model for autonomous vehicles that uses vision-language-action models to handle unfamiliar driving scenarios[2][5]. Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola K\u00e4llenius reported testing the Nvidia-powered system on public roads, driving for more than an hour through heavy traffic, with the vehicles expected to launch in the first quarter of 2026[2].\n\nAMD CEO Lisa Su showcased the company's Ryzen AI 400 series processors for PCs, claiming 1.3 times faster multitasking and 1.7 times quicker content creation compared to competitors[6][7]. The company also detailed its forthcoming MI500 series data center GPUs, asserting they will deliver up to a 1,000-fold enhancement in AI performance compared to the MI300X GPUs[7]. Intel announced its Panther Lake processors, branded as Core Ultra Series 3, featuring up to 180 platform TOPS (trillions of operations per second) for AI acceleration and claiming more than 50% faster CPU and graphics performance versus the previous generation[8]",

      "description": "A new study published this week suggests that Jupiter's moon Europa\u2014long considered one of the most promising places to search for extraterrestrial life\u2014may lack the underwater geological activity necessary to sustain organisms in its vast subsurface ocean[1][2][3][4].\n\nResearchers led by Paul Byrne, an associate professor of Earth, environmental, and planetary sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, calculated that Europa's seafloor is likely too quiet to support life today[2][3][5]. The study, published January 5 in Nature Communications, concludes that the moon probably lacks tectonic motion, warm hydrothermal vents, or other underwater geologic activity that would provide energy for potential life forms[1][2]",

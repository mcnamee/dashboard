Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object ever detected, came within 168 million miles of our planet at approximately 1 a.m. EST, according to NASA[1][2][3]. While posing no danger to Earth, the comet's unusual metal emissions have left astronomers scrambling to explain its peculiar chemistry.",

Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who presided over Bolsonaro's trial, said he did not recognize the fresh appeal, which Bolsonaro's lawyers filed three days after the 70-year-old began serving his sentence in November[1][3]. Separately, Federal Police confirmed Friday that an official medical exam found Bolsonaro has a hernia requiring surgery and that a nerve-blocking procedure for violent hiccups is \"technically appropriate,\" with doctors recommending the procedures take place \"as soon as possible\"[1][2].",

      "description": "China has successfully tested autonomous aerial refueling technology for military drones, a breakthrough that could double the operational range of its newly unveiled Jiu Tian drone carrier and bring major U.S. cities within reach, according to a report published Thursday.\n\nNorthwestern Polytechnical University conducted what appears to be China's first openly reported autonomous aerial refueling flight test, using two unidentified unmanned aerial vehicles, the South China Morning Post reported[1][2][1]. The receiving drone autonomously located, tracked and docked with a tanker aircraft during high-speed formation flights using a vision-based navigation system that achieved a 99% detection success rate with centimeter-level positioning accuracy[2][2].\n\nThe development gains significance from Northwestern Polytechnical University's direct involvement with China's Jiu Tian drone program[1][2][1]. The heavy-duty unmanned platform, which completed its maiden flight on December 11 in Shaanxi Province[3][4][5], can carry more than 200 loitering munitions and has an official range of 7,000 kilometers[1][1]. Combined with in-flight refueling capabilities, its effective strike radius could double to approximately 14,000 kilometers, placing Washington, New York and Miami within plausible reach[1][1][2].",

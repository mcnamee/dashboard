As one jet brightens, the other fades in what Loeb describes as a \"clean, repeatable and geometrically consistent swap\"[4].\n\nLoeb, a Harvard astrophysicist who leads the Galileo Project, has ranked 3I/ATLAS a \"four\" on his personal scale of zero to ten, where zero represents a natural comet and ten signifies an active alien threat[5][6]. \"You can't just say, 'I know the answer' and ignore the anomalies. That's not viable,\" Loeb said[5][6].\n\n3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, is only the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019[7][8]. The object passed Earth on December 19 at a safe distance of roughly 170 million miles and is now heading toward Jupiter, where it will make its closest approach on March 16, 2026[5][9].",

When pressed by reporters about whether the CIA or military conducted the operation, Trump declined to provide details. \"I know exactly who it was, but I don't want to say who it was,\" he said at his Mar-a-Lago residence[4][9].",

However, these gains masked what traders called one of the most volatile years in recent memory, punctuated by President Donald Trump's tariff announcements in April that sent global markets into a tailspin[4][5].\n\nThe defining moment came April 2-3, when Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement triggered the worst two-day decline for the S&P 500 since the pandemic began, with the index teetering on the brink of a bear market[4][5]. Markets rebounded dramatically on April 9 when Trump paused many tariffs for 90 days, with the S&P 500 soaring 9.5% in a single session\u2014its largest one-day gain since October 2008[4].",

Yemen's Saudi-backed Presidential Leadership Council cancelled its defense pact with the UAE and demanded all Emirati forces leave the country within 24 hours[1][3].\n\n\"The Kingdom expresses its disappointment by the actions taken by the brotherly United Arab Emirates, pressuring the Southern Transitional Council's forces to conduct military operations on the southern border of the Kingdom,\" Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry said in a statement[1][2]. The ministry called the UAE's actions \"highly dangerous\" and warned that any threat to Saudi national security is \"a red line\"[1][2].",

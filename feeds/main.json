      "description": "Territorial disputes over Donetsk have emerged as the final barrier to ending the nearly four-year war in Ukraine, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday, as trilateral negotiations between Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow prepare to resume this weekend amid concerns about the preparedness of American negotiators.\n\n\"The one remaining item \u2026 is the territorial claim on Donetsk. There is active work going to try to see if both sides' views on this can be reconciled,\" Rubio told a US Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on January 28. \"It's still a bridge we haven't crossed. It's still a gap, but at least we've been able to narrow down the issue set to one central one, and it will probably be a very difficult one.\"[1][2]\n\nRussia currently occupies roughly 70 percent of Donetsk and demands Ukraine cede the remaining territory it controls. Kyiv has refused to surrender land that Russian forces have not captured on the battlefield, with polls showing little Ukrainian public support for territorial concessions.[3][4]",

Under the proposed structure, xAI shares would be exchanged for SpaceX shares, the source said, with some xAI executives potentially offered cash instead of SpaceX stock. No final agreement has been signed, and the timing and structure remain fluid, Reuters reported.[2][1]",

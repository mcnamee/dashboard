The Iranian president also blamed Washington for his country's economic struggles, citing \"longstanding enmity and inhumane sanctions\" imposed by the United States and its allies.[1][2]\n\nPezeshkian's warning followed a sharp exchange between Trump and Khamenei on Saturday. In an interview with Politico, Trump said \"it's time to look for new leadership in Iran,\" calling the 86-year-old supreme leader \"a sick man who should run his country properly and stop killing people\". Trump added that Iran under Khamenei's rule was \"the worst place to live anywhere in the world because of poor leadership\".[3]",

The facility is intended to provide long-term energy for Russia's lunar program and the International Lunar Research Station, a joint project with China that has attracted more than a dozen participating countries[1][3].\n\nWhile Roscosmos did not explicitly confirm the plant would be nuclear, the project includes participation from Rosatom, Russia's state nuclear corporation, and the Kurchatov Institute, the country's leading nuclear research facility[1][4].

The development, published in Advanced Materials on December 23, could enable EVs to travel from Seoul to Busan and back on a single charge without increasing battery size[1][2].\n\nThe joint research team, led by Professor Soojin Park and Dr. Dong-Yeob Han of POSTECH's Department of Chemistry, together with Professor Nam-Soon Choi and Dr. Saehun Kim of KAIST, and Professor Tae Kyung Lee and researcher Junsu Son of Gyeongsang National University, eliminated the conventional graphite anode altogether[1][2][3]. Instead, lithium ions stored in the cathode deposit directly onto a copper current collector during charging, freeing up space for energy storage[1][2].",

He urged Washington to \"correct its wrong practices\" and said Beijing would take measures to safeguard its \"legitimate rights and interests\" if the U.S. persists in its actions[4][2].\n\nThe Chinese response came after the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative concluded Tuesday that China's drive for dominance in the semiconductor sector is \"unreasonable\" and burdens U.S. commerce[5][6]. However, the agency said it would maintain a zero percent tariff rate on Chinese chip imports for the next 18 months before increasing duties on June 23, 2027, to a rate that will be announced at least 30 days in advance[5][7][8].",

The approach, called space-ground fluid AI, aims to deliver artificial intelligence services globally as the race toward sixth-generation networks accelerates ahead of expected commercialization in 2030[1][2].\n\nThe research, published in the journal Engineering on December 22, addresses a fundamental challenge in extending AI capabilities beyond terrestrial networks[1][2]. According to the International Telecommunication Union, 6G will introduce new usage scenarios including \"integrated artificial intelligence and communication\" and \"ubiquitous connectivity\"[1][2]. However, ensuring continuous AI services in remote and underserved areas remains difficult with ground-based infrastructure alone.\n\nThe space-ground fluid AI framework draws its name from water's ability to flow seamlessly across boundaries. AI model parameters and data features move continuously between satellites and ground stations, adapting to the ever-changing network topology created by satellite mobility[2][3]. Professor Kaibin Huang, a key researcher on the project, noted the framework leverages satellites' predictable trajectories to enable fluid horizontal and vertical task migration across networks[4][3].",

      "description": "Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a technique that transforms flat panels into complex three-dimensional structures with a single pull of a string, potentially enabling rapid deployment of emergency shelters, medical facilities, and space habitats.\n\nThe method, presented December 17 at the Association for Computing Machinery's SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 conference in Hong Kong and announced by MIT on December 22, converts user-designed 3D structures into interconnected flat tiles that deploy smoothly with minimal friction[1][2][3]. When the string is released, the structure returns to its compact, flat configuration, allowing for repeated use without damage or reassembly[1][4][5].\n\n\"The simplicity of the whole actuation mechanism is a real benefit of our approach,\" said Akib Zaman, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student at MIT and lead author of the research paper[1][5]. \"The user just needs to provide their intended design, and then our method optimizes it in such a way that it holds the shape after just one pull on the string.\"",

The rocket's first stage performed normally, but telemetry data showed hydrogen tank pressure in the second stage began dropping during the first stage burn, JAXA executive Masashi Okada told reporters[1][2]. Whether the satellite separated from the rocket or where it ended up remains unknown[1][2].\n\nHours later, South Korean company Innospace's Hanbit-Nano rocket lifted off from Brazil's Alcantara Space Center at 10:13 p.m. local time but crashed approximately 30 seconds after liftoff[3][5][6][7]. The vehicle initially followed its planned vertical trajectory before an anomaly caused it to fall to the ground within a pre-designated safety zone, with no reported casualties[5][7][8]. The rocket was carrying eight payloads, including five satellites for undisclosed customers from Brazil and India[3][5][9].",

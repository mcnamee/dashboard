      "description": "Astronomers have confirmed that the rare interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, not an alien spacecraft, following the most comprehensive radio signal search ever conducted on an object from beyond the solar system. The confirmation comes as new observations reveal the comet is releasing water at extraordinary rates and may be among the oldest objects ever observed, potentially dating back 7 to 14 billion years[1][2][3].\n\nResults published this week from the Breakthrough Listen initiative show that multiple radio telescopes, including the Green Bank Telescope, detected no artificial signals during observations conducted as the comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025[1][4]. The Green Bank facility, the world's largest fully-steerable radio telescope, ruled out transmitters down to 0.1 watts\u2014ten times weaker than a typical cell phone\u2014during observations on December 18[1][5][6].",

Using the platform to analyze a B-21-type configuration with 288 parameters, the team found that aerodynamic optimization could increase the aircraft's lift-to-drag ratio by approximately 15 percent and improve the pitching moment from -0.2 to nearly zero, suggesting the current design may not achieve optimal stability for level flight[1][2][4].\n\nThe research comes as the B-21 Raider, built by Northrop Grumman, undergoes intensive flight testing at Edwards Air Force Base in California[4][5][6]. A second test aircraft joined the program in September 2025, marking what Air Force Secretary Troy Meink called \"substantial momentum\" for the sixth-generation stealth bomber[5][6][7].",

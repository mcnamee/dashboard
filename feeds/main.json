The unrest, which has spread to 185 cities across all 31 provinces, represents one of the most serious challenges to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's regime since the 1979 revolution[2][3].\n\nHRANA reported Sunday that more than 10,600 people have been arrested since protests erupted on December 28, when Iran's currency plummeted to historic lows against the U.S. dollar[4][1]. The agency, which has a history of accurate reporting during previous Iranian unrest, confirmed 490 protester deaths and 48 security force fatalities, though the actual toll may be higher due to a nationwide internet blackout imposed January 8[2][5].\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been briefed on military strike options for Iran and warned Tehran he would hit the regime \"very, very hard where it hurts\" if it continues killing protesters[6][7]. Iran's parliament speaker responded by threatening that U.S. troops and Israel would become \"legitimate targets\" if America intervenes militarily[8][4].",

What began as demonstrations over economic hardship has transformed into direct challenges to Iran's theocratic regime, with protesters chanting \"Death to Khamenei\" in reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei[8][9].",

The meeting comes after Denmark and Greenland requested talks with Rubio following intensifying rhetoric from the Trump administration, which has refused to rule out military force to acquire the mineral-rich island[3][4][5].\n\nTrump said Friday that the US would \"do something on Greenland whether they like it or not,\" adding that if America doesn't act, \"Russia or China will take over Greenland\"[6][7][8]. The White House confirmed Tuesday it is \"discussing a range of options\" to acquire Greenland, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt stating that \"utilizing the U.S. military is always an option\"[9][10].",

The Daily Mail reported Sunday that Trump has ordered special forces commanders to draw up invasion plans, though senior military officials are reportedly resisting the directive as unlawful[3][4].\n\nThe Telegraph reported Saturday that military planners are developing proposals for a potential NATO mission to Greenland that could involve British troops, warships and aircraft[5][6]. Downing Street has held discussions with German and French counterparts in recent days about deploying forces to demonstrate that Europe can address Arctic security concerns, according to British officials[7][5].",

Reuters could not independently verify the figures, and Iranian authorities have not released official casualty counts[1][2][3]. Some reports suggest the actual toll may be far higher, with one Tehran doctor telling TIME that at least 217 deaths had been recorded across six hospitals in the capital alone[5].\n\nMedical staff at hospitals in Tehran, Rasht, and Shiraz described facilities overwhelmed by the wounded and dead. A hospital worker in Tehran told the BBC that casualties were so numerous that \"there wasn't enough space in the morgue; the bodies were placed on top of one another\"[6][7]. Another medic reported security forces firing \"direct shots to the heads of the young people, to their hearts as well\"[6][7]. BBC Persian verified that approximately 70 bodies were brought to Poursina Hospital in Rasht on Friday night, exceeding morgue capacity[7][8].",

The anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now first reported the tender. Yoni Mizrahi, who runs the group's settlement watch division, said initial work could begin within the month[1][2][4].\n\nThe move follows Israel's final approval of the E1 project in August 2025, when the Higher Planning Council validated plans after rejecting all objections[5][6]. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right politician who oversees settlement policy, has championed the project. \"The Palestinian state is being erased from the table not with slogans but with actions,\" he said when Israel gave final approval to the plan in August[3][7]. \"Every settlement, every neighborhood, every housing unit is another nail in the coffin of this dangerous idea.\"",

The codes achieved a frame error rate as low as 10\u207b\u2074 for systems with hundreds of thousands of qubits, with decoding complexity that scales proportionally to the number of physical qubits\u2014addressing a major barrier to practical quantum computing[1][2].\n\nTraditional quantum error-correction methods hit an accuracy ceiling far below theoretical limits, requiring heavy computation that made large-scale systems impractical[1][2]. Kasai and Master's student Daiki Komoto constructed low-density parity-check codes defined over non-binary finite fields that handle both bit-flip and phase-flip errors simultaneously[3][5]. \"Our quantum error-correcting code has a greater than 1/2 code rate, targeting hundreds of thousands of logical qubits,\" Kasai said[3][4]. The breakthrough could enable quantum computers to scale to millions of logical qubits, potentially advancing drug discovery, cryptography and climate prediction[1][6].",

However, at least one in five systems degrade at least 1.5 times faster than this typical rate, and roughly one in 12 degrade twice as fast.\"\n\nFor operators of solar farms where hundreds of thousands of panels are installed, the findings represent a hidden financial risk that challenges the economic models underpinning the industry's growth[1][2][3].",

But the same AI revolution powering Nvidia's dominance is creating a global memory shortage that has forced major PC makers to implement steep price increases starting this week[5][6][7].",

More than 150 US aircraft bombed military installations across Caracas in the predawn operation, codenamed \"Absolute Resolve,\" before special forces extracted Maduro from the Venezuelan capital.[7][8] Venezuelan officials reported at least 80 people were killed, including civilians.[8]",

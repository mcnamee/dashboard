      "description": "A major scientific review warns that proposed methods to combat climate change through ocean-based interventions could pose serious risks to marine ecosystems and global food supplies, even as commercial ventures push ahead with deploying these technologies.\n\nThe review, published in Reviews of Geophysics, examines eight climate intervention strategies and concludes that while some approaches carry fewer risks than others, none is entirely safe for ocean life. The authors caution that without careful research, these interventions could disrupt the marine food chain that sustains more than a billion people worldwide.",

The meeting, which also included Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt, came as President Donald Trump doubled down on his insistence that America must control the Arctic territory.\n\nSpeaking after roughly an hour of discussions, L\u00f8kke Rasmussen told reporters that Trump has made clear his desire for the United States to acquire Greenland. \"It is absolutely not necessary for the U.S. to seize Greenland,\" he said, urging Washington to engage in \"respectful cooperation\" over the island.[1]",

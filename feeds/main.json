The protests, now in their sixth day, have spread to at least 50 cities and resulted in at least seven deaths in clashes with security forces[1][2][3][4][5].\n\nWhat started December 28 as merchants striking over a currency crisis has transformed into a nationwide uprising. Demonstrators are chanting \"Death to the dictator\" and \"Mullahs must leave Iran,\" directly targeting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei with an intensity not seen since the protests following Mahsa Amini's death in 2022[1][6][7].\n\nThe unrest reached a critical turning point when protests spread to Qom, Iran's clerical stronghold and the ideological heart of the Islamic Republic. Videos from the holy city showed demonstrators fighting back against security forces and chanting slogans calling for the clergy's removal, representing a profound symbolic blow to the regime[6][8][7].",

The unprecedented overture comes as Venezuela's economy buckles under an American blockade that has slashed oil production and sparked the first confirmed US strike on Venezuelan territory.\n\nIn the interview with Spanish journalist Ignacio Ramonet, Maduro declared that \"if they want Venezuela's oil, Venezuela is ready to accept US investments like those of Chevron, when, where and how they want to make them,\" according to Reuters[1][2]. He also proposed \"serious\" talks on drug trafficking and migration, telling the American people that Venezuela is \"a brother country\" with \"a friendly government\"[1][3].\n\nThe softened rhetoric marks a stark departure for Maduro, who has spent recent weeks condemning what he calls US attempts to seize Venezuela's resources. The shift coincides with intensifying economic pain from President Trump's December 16 declaration of a \"total and complete blockade\" on sanctioned oil tankers[4][5], which has paralyzed exports and forced Venezuela to begin shutting oil wells.",

The microscopic sand grains, which show internal damage from extreme heat and pressure, were found at Murray Springs in Arizona, Blackwater Draw in New Mexico, and Arlington Canyon in California's Channel Islands[3][1][2].\n\nAccording to the University of California - Santa Barbara, shocked quartz is considered one of the most reliable indicators of cosmic impact[1]. Using electron microscopy and cathodoluminescence, the team confirmed the quartz grains contained distinctive fractures filled with melted silica, formed under conditions far exceeding those of volcanic activity or early human fires[1][2].",

The findings suggest that bipedalism \u2014 a defining feature of the human lineage \u2014 emerged far earlier than many scientists previously believed.\n\nThe study, led by Scott Williams, an associate professor at New York University, reexamined limb bones from *Sahelanthropus tchadensis*, a species discovered in Chad's Djurab Desert in the early 2000s. Using high-resolution 3D analysis, Williams and his team identified a small projection on the thigh bone called a femoral tubercle, which serves as the attachment point for the iliofemoral ligament[1][2][3]. Until now, this feature had been documented only in bipedal hominins.\n\n\"Our analysis of these fossils offers direct evidence that *Sahelanthropus tchadensis* could walk on two legs, demonstrating that bipedalism evolved early in our lineage and from an ancestor that looked most similar to today's chimpanzees and bonobos,\" Williams said[1][4].",

      "description": "Swiss authorities announced Friday that fountain candles attached to champagne bottles likely ignited the devastating New Year's Eve fire that killed 40 people and injured more than 100 at a ski resort bar in Crans-Montana[1][2][3]. Prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud said initial investigations point to bar staff holding the sparkling candles too close to the ceiling, triggering a rapid conflagration that engulfed the packed venue in seconds.\n\n\"Everything suggests that the fire started from the burning candles or 'Bengal lights' that had been attached to champagne bottles,\" Pilloud told a news conference Friday[1][2][3]. \"These went too close to the ceiling. From there, a rapid, very rapid and widespread conflagration ensued.\"",

      "description": "The new year has arrived with a celestial spectacle that sets the stage for what space enthusiasts are calling one of the most ambitious years in modern space exploration. Skywatchers in the Northern Hemisphere are witnessing the Quadrantid meteor shower, coinciding with January's full Wolf supermoon, as space agencies worldwide prepare for historic lunar and planetary missions.\n\nThe Quadrantid meteor shower reached its peak between Friday, January 2, and Saturday, January 3, according to the American Meteor Society[1][2][3]. Under ideal conditions, the shower typically produces around 25 meteors per hour, with some years seeing up to 120 meteors per hour[1][4]. However, this year's viewing conditions are far from ideal. The full Wolf supermoon, which officially reached peak illumination at 5:03 a.m. EST on January 3, has washed out all but the brightest streaking meteors[5][6][7]. \"The biggest enemy of enjoying a meteor shower is the full moon,\" Mike Shanahan, planetarium director at Liberty Science Center, told the Associated Press[8].\n\nThe Quadrantids are unusual among meteor showers because they originate from an asteroid rather than a comet. Astronomers traced the shower's source to asteroid 2003 EH1, which orbits the sun every 5.5 years[9][3]. The shower is named after Quadrans Muralis, a constellation identified in 1795 that was later removed from the official list in 1922[9][10].",

      "description": "NASA's space telescopes have captured extraordinary views of previously unseen cosmic events in recent weeks, providing scientists with fresh insights into galactic evolution and exotic planetary systems.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope on January 1 released new imagery of NGC 4388, a spiral galaxy 60 million light-years away in the Virgo constellation, revealing a luminous plume of gas streaming from the galaxy's nucleus[1]. The phenomenon, invisible in previous Hubble observations from 2016, occurs as NGC 4388 plunges through the intracluster medium\u2014hot wisps of gas occupying the space between galaxies in the Virgo cluster[1][2].\n\nAs the galaxy moves through this medium, pressure from the hot gas strips material from NGC 4388's disk, causing it to trail behind in a glowing tail[1]. Researchers suspect a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center provides some of the ionizing energy that causes the gas cloud to glow, while shock waves may be responsible for ionizing filaments farther out[1][3].",

He also offered U.S. investment in Venezuela's oil sector similar to Chevron's operations[1][3][6].\n\nThe interview, recorded on New Year's Eve, came weeks after the CIA conducted a drone strike in early December on a dock along Venezuela's coast believed to be used by the Tren de Aragua gang to store and ship narcotics[2][7][8]. No one was present during the strike, and no casualties were reported[7][8]. When asked about the operation, Maduro declined to comment but suggested he could \"talk about it in a few days\"[9][10].",

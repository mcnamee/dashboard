      "description": "Conservative candidate Nasry Asfura has won Honduras' presidential election after more than three weeks of vote counting marred by technical failures, fraud allegations and accusations of U.S. interference, the National Electoral Council announced Wednesday.\n\nAsfura, a 67-year-old businessman and former mayor of Tegucigalpa backed by President Donald Trump, secured 40.3% of the votes, narrowly defeating center-right Liberal Party candidate Salvador Nasralla, who received 39.5%[1][2]. The results from the November 30 election required a manual recount of approximately 15% of ballot tally sheets\u2014representing hundreds of thousands of votes\u2014due to inconsistencies in the disorganized counting system[1][2].",

The Italian think tank indicated that Khamenei had consistently blocked the final decision to escalate to 90 percent weapons-grade enrichment and initiate miniaturized warhead creation, despite pressure from the Revolutionary Guards[2][3].\n\nISPI's analysis suggests the June conflict fundamentally altered Iran's strategic calculus. The 12-day war, which ran from June 13-24, revealed Iran's air defense systems were largely ineffective, with only medium-range missile capabilities proving reliable[2][3][4]. Tehran may have concluded that nuclear weapons would serve as its only viable deterrent against Israel and the United States, the report stated[2][3].",

      "description": "International space agencies are gearing up for an intensive year of lunar and interplanetary exploration, with NASA, China, India, and Europe planning historic missions that could reshape human understanding of the solar system.\n\nNASA's Artemis II mission leads the charge, targeting a launch as early as February 5, 2026, according to agency officials[1][2]. The 10-day lunar flyby will carry four astronauts\u2014Commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, mission specialist Christina Koch, and Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen\u2014marking humanity's first crewed journey beyond low Earth orbit since Apollo 17 in 1972[3][4]. The crew has named their Orion spacecraft \"Integrity\"[5][6].\n\nChina plans to launch Chang'e 7 to the Moon's south pole in August 2026, where the mission will search for water ice deposits using an innovative \"hopping\" probe equipped with a water molecule analyzer[7][8]. The spacecraft will include an orbiter, lander, rover, and flying probe, spending up to two months examining permanently shadowed craters near Shackleton crater[7][9]. China also expects to launch its Xuntian space telescope by late December 2026, a facility with a field of view 300 times larger than Hubble's that will co-orbit with the Tiangong space station[10][11].\n\nIndia's space agency ISRO aims to conduct its first uncrewed Gaganyaan test flight by March 2026, carrying Vyommitra, a humanoid test robot[12][13]. The mission will validate critical systems for India's planned 2027 crewed spaceflight, making India potentially the fourth nation to independently launch astronauts[12][14]. ISRO Chairman V. Narayanan confirmed that 90% of Gaganyaan's development work has been completed, with human-rated launch vehicles and life support systems nearing completion[15].",

      "description": "Gold, silver and platinum prices pulled back on Wednesday after reaching unprecedented peaks earlier in the session, as investors paused following a historic rally that has seen precious metals emerge as one of 2025's most profitable trades.\n\nSpot gold edged down 0.4% to $4,468.96 per ounce by mid-morning after touching a record high of $4,525.18[1][2], while silver retreated 0.8% to $70.86 after hitting an all-time peak of $72.70[1][2]. Platinum fell 3.3% to $2,198.30 after reaching $2,377.50[1][3][4], its highest level ever. The pullback reflects what analysts described as chart consolidation and mild profit-taking rather than a fundamental shift in sentiment.\n\n\"The gold market is seeing some chart consolidation and mild profit-taking after record highs,\" said Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst at Kitco Metals[1]. Year-to-date, gold has gained over 70%, while silver has surged 147%, outpacing all other precious metals[1][5][6].",

The interim order requires Meta to allow rival AI services access to WhatsApp while the investigation continues[3][4].\n\nMeta called the decision \"fundamentally flawed\" and announced it would appeal, arguing that AI chatbots \"put a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support\"[1][2]. A Meta spokesperson added that the Italian authority assumes WhatsApp is \"somehow a defacto app store,\" when the route to market for AI companies should be app stores, websites, and industry partnerships[4].",

      "description": "President Donald Trump's renewed push to bring Greenland under American control has drawn fierce opposition from European allies and a coordinated rebuke from more than 200 U.S. scientists, even as mining experts say the island's mineral wealth may be far more difficult to access than the administration suggests.\n\n\"We are going to do something on Greenland whether they like it or not,\" Trump declared on Friday during a White House meeting with oil executives[1][2]. \"If we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way.\"\n\nThe remarks, coming days after U.S. military forces removed Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on January 3, have alarmed European leaders and prompted Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to declare that her country faces a \"decisive moment\" in its diplomatic struggle with Washington[3][4].",

The researchers based their findings on satellite imagery from Planet Labs showing hurried construction that began in August[2][3].\n\n\"One dead giveaway in a November 19 photo is a military-grade rail transfer point enclosed by a security fence to which missiles, their mobile launchers and other components could be delivered by train,\" Eveleth said[2]. The imagery also revealed a concrete pad at the end of the runway that was covered with earth, consistent with a camouflaged launch point[2][3].",

The object displays an unusual \"anti-tail\" pointing toward the Sun and containing particles far larger than typical cometary dust, behaviors that have prompted researchers to reexamine existing models of how comets form and evolve[4][2][5].\n\nAstronomers using the Two-meter Twin Telescope at Teide Observatory in Tenerife detected wobbling jets within the anti-tail during an intensive 37-night observation campaign between July and September 2025[1][6]. This periodic motion allowed researchers to calculate that 3I/ATLAS's nucleus rotates once every 14 to 17 hours, marking the first time scientists have directly measured the rotation period of an interstellar comet from its surface activity[1][6].",

      "description": "Nigerian government officials and security analysts have strongly rejected President Donald Trump's characterization that U.S. airstrikes in northwestern Nigeria on Christmas Day were necessary to stop a genocide of Christians, insisting that Islamic extremist violence in the West African nation affects both Muslim and Christian communities equally.\n\n\"It has nothing to do with a particular religion,\" Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar told the BBC following the strikes in Sokoto State[1][2]. \"It is about protecting Nigerians and innocent lives, whether Nigerian or non-Nigerian.\"\n\nThe joint U.S.-Nigerian operation, which U.S. Africa Command said killed \"multiple ISIS terrorists,\" came after months of Trump threatening military action over what he described as systematic killing of Christians[3]. In announcing the strikes on Truth Social, Trump claimed militants had been \"targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!\"[4][5]",

The fiscal 2026 budget, which begins in April, represents the fourth year of Japan's five-year program to double annual arms spending to 2% of gross domestic product, positioning the country to become the world's third-largest defense spender after the United States and China[2][5][6].\n\n\"This budget represents the absolute minimum required for Japan to fulfill its defense obligations as it faces its most severe and complex security environment in the postwar period,\" Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi told reporters Friday[7][8]. The draft budget, part of a record 122.3 trillion yen ($784 billion) national spending plan, requires parliamentary approval by March to take effect[2][4][9].",

Trump had threatened military intervention as early as November, warning the U.S. would enter Nigeria \"guns-a-blazing\" if violence against Christians continued[5][6]. The Pentagon declined to provide details on casualties or specific targets struck[2][4].",

The breakthrough marks the fastest superconducting electric maglev speed ever recorded and positions China at the forefront of ultra-high-speed transportation development.\n\nThe test, conducted by the National University of Defense Technology on a 400-meter track, saw the vehicle reach extreme acceleration before coming to a safe stop[1][2][5][4]. Footage released by CCTV showed the vehicle resembling a chassis flashing across the track, leaving a trail of mist in its wake[3]. The achievement follows a decade of research overcoming technical challenges including ultra-high-speed electromagnetic propulsion, electric suspension guidance, and high-field superconducting magnets[2][6][7].",

      "description": "Chinese researchers have developed advanced simulation software that suggests potential aerodynamic and stability shortcomings in publicly available designs of the United States' B-21 Raider stealth bomber, according to a study published last month in a peer-reviewed aerospace journal.\n\nThe software system, called PADJ-X, was detailed in December 2025 by researchers led by Huang Jiangtao from the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre in a paper published in Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica[1][2][3][4]. Using the platform to analyze a B-21-type configuration with 288 parameters, the team found that aerodynamic optimization could increase the aircraft's lift-to-drag ratio by approximately 15 percent and improve the pitching moment from -0.2 to nearly zero, suggesting the current design may not achieve optimal stability for level flight[1][2][4].\n\nThe research comes as the B-21 Raider, built by Northrop Grumman, undergoes intensive flight testing at Edwards Air Force Base in California[4][5][6]. A second test aircraft joined the program in September 2025, marking what Air Force Secretary Troy Meink called \"substantial momentum\" for the sixth-generation stealth bomber[5][6][7].",

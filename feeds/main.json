According to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, the country placed 322 satellites in orbit through November 30, a 22 percent increase over the previous year[4]. The surge was driven largely by deployments for two megaconstellations\u2014the government-backed Guowang and Shanghai's Qianfan\u2014each designed to exceed 10,000 satellites to compete with SpaceX's Starlink network[9][10][11].",

The 10-day lunar flyby will carry four astronauts\u2014Commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, mission specialist Christina Koch, and Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen\u2014marking humanity's first crewed journey beyond low Earth orbit since Apollo 17 in 1972[3][4]. The crew has named their Orion spacecraft \"Integrity\"[5][6].\n\nChina plans to launch Chang'e 7 to the Moon's south pole in August 2026, where the mission will search for water ice deposits using an innovative \"hopping\" probe equipped with a water molecule analyzer[7][8]. The spacecraft will include an orbiter, lander, rover, and flying probe, spending up to two months examining permanently shadowed craters near Shackleton crater[7][9]. China also expects to launch its Xuntian space telescope by late December 2026, a facility with a field of view 300 times larger than Hubble's that will co-orbit with the Tiangong space station[10][11].\n\nIndia's space agency ISRO aims to conduct its first uncrewed Gaganyaan test flight by March 2026, carrying Vyommitra, a humanoid test robot[12][13]. The mission will validate critical systems for India's planned 2027 crewed spaceflight, making India potentially the fourth nation to independently launch astronauts[12][14]. ISRO Chairman V. Narayanan confirmed that 90% of Gaganyaan's development work has been completed, with human-rated launch vehicles and life support systems nearing completion[15].",

Gold touched an all-time high of $4,525.03 in December, trading near $4,493 per ounce on December 24\u2014up more than 70% from a year earlier[3]. Silver reached a record $72.70 per troy ounce, marking its fifth consecutive year of supply deficits and posting a 142% annual gain[4].",

Radio observations conducted the day before by the Breakthrough Listen program using the Green Bank Telescope found no artificial signals, reporting a nondetection of candidate transmissions down to 100 milliwatts[4][6][7]. South Africa's MeerKAT telescope had previously detected hydroxyl signatures in October, confirming the presence of water molecules being broken apart by solar radiation[8][9][10].",

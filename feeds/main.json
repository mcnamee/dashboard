The study, published in Nature Communications, was announced on January 5, 2026[1][2].\n\nThe research team, led by Michael Wong, professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at Rice, demonstrated how palladium-acetate trimers and dimers transform under reaction conditions to control catalyst performance in VAM manufacturing[1]. VAM serves as a core ingredient in adhesives, paints, coatings, packaging, textiles and numerous other consumer products[3][1].",

The proposal would establish a demilitarized area, though uncertainty remains over who would govern the territory[3]",

The six-chip system, which includes the Rubin GPU and new Vera CPU, delivers up to five times more AI training power than the current Blackwell architecture while reducing inference token costs by roughly one-tenth, according to Nvidia[3][6][8].\n\nHuang also unveiled Alpamayo, an open-source family of AI models designed specifically for autonomous vehicles[9][10]. The system uses chain-of-thought reasoning to help self-driving cars navigate complex scenarios and explain their decisions. Mercedes-Benz plans to integrate Alpamayo into its upcoming CLA model, set to arrive at U.S. dealerships in the first quarter of 2026[11]",

      "description": "Devastating floods continued to strike across multiple continents this week, killing dozens and displacing thousands as scientists warn that climate change and widespread deforestation are amplifying extreme weather disasters worldwide.\n\nCalifornia faced record flooding over the weekend, with rare \"king tides\" combining with heavy rainfall to inundate coastal areas from Santa Barbara to San Francisco[1][2][3]. One person died in Santa Barbara County after being swept into a creek, while the Santa Barbara Airport closed operations due to floodwaters covering runways[1][2]. San Francisco recorded its highest tide since 1998, with water levels reaching 2.56 feet above normal[3][4].\n\nIn Queensland, Australia, catastrophic flooding killed at least one person and left more than 19,000 livestock dead or missing as of Monday[5][6]. The Australian government announced a $38 million disaster recovery package for affected communities[5][7]. Meanwhile, flash floods in Indonesia's North Sulawesi province killed at least 14 people on Monday, with six others still missing[8]",

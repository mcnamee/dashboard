The timing of Loeb's proposal came just two days after 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, passing within 168 million miles of our planet[5][6].\n\n\"Riding 3I/ATLAS offers the benefit of reaching interstellar space by the year ~10,000 CE instead of the year ~30,000 CE,\" Loeb wrote, comparing the comet's trajectory to NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft[1][4]. The Voyager probe, launched in 1977, travels at 17 kilometers per second and will require another 28,000 years to reach the assumed edge of the solar system, according to Loeb's calculations[1]. In contrast, 3I/ATLAS moves at 60 kilometers per second, cutting the journey time by more than two-thirds[1].",

      "description": "Astronomers have unveiled two breakthroughs that deepen understanding of how black holes behave in extreme environments, with findings reported this week revealing both the most accurate simulations of black hole behavior ever created and mounting evidence for an exotic new class of cosmic objects powered by black holes in the early universe.\n\nA study published December 3 in The Astrophysical Journal presents the first simulations to successfully model luminous black hole accretion without simplifying assumptions, using the world's most powerful supercomputers to solve Einstein's equations of general relativity while fully accounting for radiation[1][2][3]. Meanwhile, observations from the James Webb Space Telescope suggest that mysterious \"little red dots\" discovered in the distant universe are actually \"black hole stars\"\u2014supermassive black holes wrapped in dense gas envelopes that glow like giant stars\u2014according to analysis published today in New Scientist[4].",

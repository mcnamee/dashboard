At such distances, most small bodies would fade into obscurity, yet 3I/ATLAS remains visible and active.[1][2]",

The deal, which the White House was set to announce Thursday, places Taiwan on equal footing with Japan and South Korea, which secured similar arrangements last year.[1][2]\n\nUnder the agreement, Taiwanese semiconductor companies will commit to a $500 billion increase in financing for American operations, with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. pledging to build at least five additional fabrication plants in Arizona, effectively doubling its manufacturing presence in the state.[2][3][1]",

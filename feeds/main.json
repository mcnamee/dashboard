But a new strand of physics research is reviving an old, unsettling possibility: **time may not be fundamental at all**, and what humans experience as \u201cflow\u201d could instead be a byproduct of how the universe stores and spreads information.\n\nIn an essay published January 28, physicist Florian Neukart of Leiden University argued that modern physics still lacks a unified account of time, in part because its two pillars treat it differently: **Einstein\u2019s relativity** folds time into spacetime, while **quantum mechanics** typically assumes time as an external parameter. Attempts to combine the two, he wrote, can even yield equations in which time \u201cdisappears,\u201d a long-running difficulty known as the \u201cproblem of time\u201d.[1][2][3]",

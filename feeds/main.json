      "description": "Prince Harry arrived at London's High Court on Monday, waving to reporters and saying \"good morning\" as he entered via a side entrance for the start of what his legal team calls the \"final chapter\" of his crusade against British tabloid media. The Duke of Sussex, 41, sat in the back row of the courtroom alongside actresses Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost as his barrister, David Sherborne, alleged the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday engaged in \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering\" spanning two decades.[1][2]\n\nThe civil trial, expected to last nine weeks, sees Harry and six other high-profile claimants accusing Associated Newspapers Limited of illegal practices including phone hacking, hiring private investigators to plant listening devices in homes and cars, and obtaining medical and financial records through deception\u2014a practice known as \"blagging\". The publisher has \"vigorously denied\" all allegations, calling them \"preposterous smears\" and part of a \"coordinated effort\" against the media.[3][4][5]",

      "description": "Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi announced Monday that she will dissolve parliament on Friday and hold a snap general election on February 8, just three months after becoming the country's first female leader. The move sets the stage for a high-stakes campaign as Takaichi seeks a stronger mandate to advance her fiscal policies and hardline security stance amid escalating tensions with China.\n\n\"I want the public to decide whether Sanae Takaichi is suitable as prime minister,\" she told reporters at a press conference in Tokyo. Official campaigning will begin on January 27, with only 16 days between the dissolution and voting day, the shortest such period since the end of World War II.[1][2]",

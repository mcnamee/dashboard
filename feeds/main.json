      "description": "Researchers at the University of New South Wales have uncovered a troubling pattern in solar panel performance, finding that approximately 20% of panels examined degrade much more rapidly than industry expectations, potentially lasting only half their anticipated 25-year lifespan.\n\nThe study, published in IEEE and released January 5, analyzed data from nearly 11,000 photovoltaic systems worldwide to investigate what scientists call the \"long tail\" problem\u2014where a subset of panels fails far more quickly than the average degradation rate[1][2][3].\n\n\"Most solar systems are designed to last around 25 years, based on their warranty period,\" said Yang Tang, a PhD student at UNSW's School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering and co-author of the paper[1][3][4]. \"For the entire dataset, we observed that system performance typically declines by around 0.9% per year. However, at least one in five systems degrade at least 1.5 times faster than this typical rate, and roughly one in 12 degrade twice as fast.\"\n\nFor operators of solar farms where hundreds of thousands of panels are installed, the findings represent a hidden financial risk that challenges the economic models underpinning the industry's growth[1][2][3].",

More than 150 US aircraft bombed military installations across Caracas in the predawn operation, codenamed \"Absolute Resolve,\" before special forces extracted Maduro from the Venezuelan capital.[7][8] Venezuelan officials reported at least 80 people were killed, including civilians.[8]",

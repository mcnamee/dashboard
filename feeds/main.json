      "description": "The past 11 years have been the warmest in modern history, the World Meteorological Organization confirmed last week, as scientists warn that global warming is intensifying heatwaves, floods, and storms while threatening water supplies for more than a billion people.\n\nThe WMO reported that 2025 ranked among the three warmest years on record, with global average surface temperatures reaching 1.44\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Six of eight international climate datasets ranked 2025 as the third-warmest year, while two ranked it second-warmest in the 176-year temperature record. The findings came despite the cooling influence of La Ni\u00f1a conditions at the start and end of the year.[1][2][3]\n\n\"The year 2025 started and ended with a cooling La Ni\u00f1a and yet it was still one of the warmest years on record globally because of the accumulation of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in our atmosphere,\" said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.[2][1]",

      "description": "A new report from the Pew Research Center released Wednesday reveals that Catholicism continues to decline across Latin America, with the Catholic share of the population falling by at least 9 percentage points in each of six major countries surveyed over the past decade. The findings mirror broader trends of Christian disaffiliation documented by Pew across Europe, where millions have left the faith since childhood.\n\nThe report, titled \"Catholicism Has Declined in Latin America Over the Past Decade,\" is based on surveys of more than 6,200 adults conducted in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru between January and April 2024. These six nations collectively represent about 75% of Latin America's population.[1][2]\n\n\"Our analysis found that the Catholic share of the population in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru has significantly declined since 2013-14, while a growing share of adults in the region are religiously unaffiliated,\" said Kirsten Lesage, a Pew research associate and the report's lead author.[3][4]",

      "description": "Scientists confirmed Friday that 2025 was among the three hottest years ever recorded globally while the United Kingdom experienced its warmest and sunniest year since measurements began, marking a milestone in the accelerating climate crisis as the three-year temperature average exceeded the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C warming threshold for the first time[1][2][3][4][5].\n\nThe Met Office reported the UK's mean temperature reached 10.09\u00b0C in 2025, surpassing the previous record of 10.03\u00b0C set in 2022[3][4][5]. The reading makes 2025 only the second year since 1884 that the UK's annual temperature has topped 10\u00b0C, and places four of the last five years in the top five warmest on record[3][4][5]. The UK also recorded 1648.5 hours of sunshine, 61.4 hours more than the previous record set in 2003[4][6].\n\nGlobally, 2025 ranked as one of the three hottest years recorded, joining 2023 and trailing 2024, which the World Meteorological Organization confirmed in January as the warmest year at 1.55\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels[2][7][8]. More concerning to climate scientists, the three-year period from 2023 to 2025 marked the first time the running temperature average broke through the 1.5\u00b0C threshold established in the 2015 Paris Agreement[2][9][10][11].",

      "description": "As 2026 begins, investors and policymakers are confronting a landscape defined by elevated geopolitical tensions and divergent economic forecasts, with Asia caught between U.S. policy unpredictability and Middle Eastern instability that sent gold surging above $4,300 per ounce on the year's first trading day.\n\nEscalating U.S.-Iran tensions dominated early market sentiment, with President Donald Trump issuing a \"locked and loaded\" warning on January 2 following massive protests in Iran sparked by inflation exceeding 42%[1]. The rhetoric rekindled fears of direct military conflict after U.S. and Israeli forces reportedly struck Iranian nuclear facilities in June 2025, pushing investors toward safe-haven assets[1]. Meanwhile, experts warn that the Middle East's \"armed peace\" remains fragile, with analysts at SpecialEurasia assessing that the region faces \"high-probability\" prospects of renewed Israeli-Iranian conflict in early 2026[2].",

      "description": "Iran is confronting its most serious wave of unrest since 2022, as demonstrations that began over economic grievances have rapidly evolved into open defiance of the country's theocratic leadership. The protests, now in their sixth day, have spread to at least 50 cities and resulted in at least seven deaths in clashes with security forces[1][2][3][4][5].\n\nWhat started December 28 as merchants striking over a currency crisis has transformed into a nationwide uprising. Demonstrators are chanting \"Death to the dictator\" and \"Mullahs must leave Iran,\" directly targeting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei with an intensity not seen since the protests following Mahsa Amini's death in 2022[1][6][7].\n\nThe unrest reached a critical turning point when protests spread to Qom, Iran's clerical stronghold and the ideological heart of the Islamic Republic. Videos from the holy city showed demonstrators fighting back against security forces and chanting slogans calling for the clergy's removal, representing a profound symbolic blow to the regime[6][8][7].",

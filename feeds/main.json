      "description": "Novak Djokovic turned back the clock in the early hours of Saturday morning in Melbourne, outlasting two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner in a grueling five-set semifinal to reach his 11th Australian Open final. The 38-year-old Serbian prevailed 3-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 in four hours and nine minutes, finishing at 1:32 a.m. local time, to become the oldest man in the Open Era to reach the championship match at Melbourne Park.\n\nThe victory snapped Djokovic's five-match losing streak against Sinner, his first win over the Italian since November 2023, and propelled him one match away from a record-extending 25th Grand Slam title that would surpass Margaret Court's all-time mark of 24 major singles championships.",

And the situation will deteriorate further in the near future,\" Guterres wrote in the correspondence, obtained by Reuters.[1][2][3]\n\nThe alarm comes weeks after President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on January 7 directing the withdrawal of the United States from 66 international organizations, including 31 UN entities, deeming them \"contrary to the interests of the United States\".[4][5]",

The 34-year-old Fedorov, who took over the ministry with what he described as a 300 billion hryvnia ($6.9 billion) budget deficit, called for urgent reforms to address problems \"that have accumulated over the years\".[1][2][3][4][5]",

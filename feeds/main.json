The new map, published January 26 in Nature Astronomy, confirms with unprecedented clarity how dark matter's gravity shaped the structure of the cosmos by drawing normal matter toward it throughout billions of years of cosmic history.[1][2]\n\nThe research, led by scientists from Durham University in the United Kingdom and Northeastern University in the United States as part of the COSMOS-Web collaboration, analyzed Webb observations of a section of sky about 2.5 times larger than the full moon in the constellation Sextans.[3][1]",

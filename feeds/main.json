      "description": "Oil prices fell for the first time in six trading sessions on Thursday after President Donald Trump indicated the United States would hold off on military action against Iran, easing fears of supply disruptions in the Middle East.\n\nBrent crude slid more than 3% to around $64 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate dropped to approximately $60, erasing much of the 11% gain the benchmarks had accumulated over the previous week.[1][2][3]\n\nThe retreat came after Trump said Wednesday that he had received assurances Iran would cease killing anti-government protesters. \"The killing has stopped. The executions have stopped,\" Trump said from the Oval Office, without identifying the source of his information.[4][5]",

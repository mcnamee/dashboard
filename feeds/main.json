Scientists at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) have demonstrated that AI models learn more efficiently, adapt to new situations more easily, and handle multiple tasks better when trained to use internal \"mumbling\" alongside short-term memory systems.\n\nThe findings, published in Neural Computation on January 28, reveal that combining self-directed inner speech with working memory architecture allows AI to generalize across different tasks more effectively while requiring far less training data than conventional approaches.[1][2]",

      "description": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Tuesday that the Trump administration is prepared to use military force to ensure Venezuela's acting President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez complies with American demands, escalating tensions nearly a month after US special forces captured Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in a dramatic predawn raid on Caracas.[1][2]\n\nThe warning came as Colombia's President Gustavo Petro called for Maduro to be returned to Venezuela to face trial in his home country rather than in the United States. \"They have to return him and have him tried by a Venezuelan court, not a US one,\" Petro said Tuesday, one week before a scheduled February 3 meeting with Trump at the White House.[3][4][5]",

The negotiations are part of CEO Sam Altman's globe-spanning effort to secure capital from deep-pocketed investors, including Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds.[3][4][5][6]",

The breakthrough, published this week in the journal Advanced Materials, replaces the scarce and expensive metal with nanoparticles made from electrically conductive plastic[1][2][3][4].\n\nThe innovation addresses a critical challenge in the transition to renewable energy. While hydrogen produces only water as a byproduct when used, its production has long relied on platinum as a co-catalyst\u2014a metal with limited global reserves concentrated primarily in South Africa and Russia, according to the research team[2][3]. The extraction process poses environmental and health risks, and platinum's scarcity has hampered efforts to scale green hydrogen production[2][3].",

However, both indices retreated by the close, ending their three-day winning streaks[2][3]. The Nasdaq Composite edged slightly higher, supported by strength in large-cap technology stocks[2][3].",

Lead author Siddharth Doshi, a doctoral student in materials science and engineering at Stanford, explained that the technology replicates essential elements of camouflage found in octopuses, cuttlefish, and squid across various environments[4][5].",

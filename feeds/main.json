      "description": "Gold and silver are poised to end 2025 with their most impressive annual gains in more than four decades, despite sharp late-December selloffs that underscored the extraordinary volatility in precious metals markets.\n\nGold climbed approximately 66% this year, while silver surged over 150%, according to multiple market sources[1][2][3][4]. Both metals are heading for their strongest yearly performance since 1979, when the Iranian Revolution and runaway inflation drove gold up 126%[1][5][6][7].\n\nThe year-end rally turned turbulent in late December when CME Group raised margin requirements on precious metals futures twice within a week[8][9][10]. The exchange cited \"market volatility to ensure adequate collateral coverage\" as silver broke above $80 per ounce for the first time and gold approached $4,550[8][11]. Silver margins jumped approximately 30%, while gold requirements rose roughly 9%, forcing traders to post additional cash during one of the year's thinnest trading periods[12][10].\n\nSilver plunged nearly 9% on Monday, December 29, to just above $73 per ounce after briefly exceeding $84 over the weekend[13]. Gold dropped more than 4% to around $4,355[13]. Both metals staged recoveries on Tuesday before falling again Wednesday, with silver declining more than 8% and gold slipping approximately 0.75%[13][14].",

The actual damage to the cables occurred in Estonia's economic zone[1][3][2].\n\n\"Finland is prepared for a range of security challenges and will respond as required,\" President Alexander Stubb said in a statement on social media[1].

Helsinki Police Department is investigating the incident as aggravated criminal damage, attempted aggravated criminal damage, and aggravated interference with telecommunications[1][3][2].

      "description": "Stock markets worldwide capped 2025 with robust gains, as emerging markets outpaced developed peers for the first time in five years and artificial intelligence infrastructure spending drove a shift in technology sector leadership beyond the usual giants.\n\nThe MSCI All Country World Index, tracking over 2,500 stocks across developed and emerging markets, rose more than 21% through late December to reach record highs[1][2]. Even more striking, the MSCI ACWI Ex-US index achieved its best performance since the 2009 global financial crisis, climbing approximately 30% as investors diversified away from concentrated U.S. positions[3][4]. By comparison, the S&P 500 gained 18.7% for the year, marking its third consecutive annual advance[5][6].\n\nSouth Korea's KOSPI index led all major global markets with a stunning 75.6% gain, its strongest annual performance since 1999[7][8]. The rally was powered by semiconductor manufacturers SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics, whose shares surged approximately 280% and 125% respectively on surging demand for high-bandwidth memory chips used in AI systems[7][9].\n\nLatin America emerged as an unexpected star, with Colombia's equity market skyrocketing over 91% to claim the top spot globally, according to data compiled by Morningstar for CNBC[1]. Chile, Peru, Mexico, and Brazil all posted gains exceeding 45%, establishing the region as a standout performer[1]. Analysts attributed Colombia's rally to low initial valuations, improving investor sentiment ahead of presidential elections, and a Colombian peso that appreciated nearly 15% against the dollar[1].",

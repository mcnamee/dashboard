Among the discoveries are deep alpine valleys, extensive channels carved by ancient flowing water that stretch for hundreds of kilometers, and sharp transitions between highland and lowland terrain that may indicate tectonic boundaries.[4][3][1]",

      "description": "President Donald Trump's national security advisers have cautioned him that a substantial military strike against Iran would probably not lead to the collapse of the Islamic Republic's government and could instead trigger a wider regional conflict, according to U.S. officials familiar with the discussions. The assessment came as Trump signaled a potential pause in his escalating threats against Tehran, saying Wednesday he had been informed that killings of protesters had stopped.\n\nThe president has communicated to his advisers that he wants any military action to be \"swift and decisive\" and deliver a \"definitive\" blow to the regime, according to NBC News. However, officials said his team has been unable to guarantee that outcome, with concerns mounting that the United States may lack sufficient military assets in the region to defend against what is expected to be an aggressive Iranian response.[1][2]",

      "description": "As Brazil's Atlantic Forest shrinks and wildlife vanishes, mosquitoes are increasingly targeting humans for their blood meals, raising fresh concerns about the spread of diseases such as dengue, Zika, and yellow fever, according to a study published this week in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution.\n\nThe research, conducted by scientists at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, analyzed blood samples from mosquitoes captured in nature reserves within the Atlantic Forest. The results showed a pronounced shift: of the identifiable blood meals, 18 came from humans\u2014far outpacing other sources, which included only six birds, one amphibian, one rodent, and one canid.[1][2][3]",

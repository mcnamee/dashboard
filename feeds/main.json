His confirmation ends nearly a year of leadership uncertainty at NASA as the agency confronts severe budget cuts and prepares for its first crewed lunar mission in over five decades.\n\nThe U.S. Senate confirmed Isaacman in a 67-30 vote on Wednesday, following a tumultuous nomination process[4][5]. President Donald Trump first nominated Isaacman in December 2024, withdrew the nomination in May amid tensions with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, then renominated him in November[6][7].\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly administered the oath of office during a ceremony at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington[1][8]. Isaacman replaces Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who had served as acting administrator since July[9][2].",

      "description": "Astronomers observing the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS have captured the first dual X-ray portraits of an object from beyond our solar system, revealing a 250,000-mile-wide glow and chemical signatures that challenge understanding of materials formed around distant stars. The European Space Agency's XMM-Newton observatory observed the comet for 20 hours on Dec. 3, following earlier observations by the Japanese-led XRISM mission in late November[1][2][3][4][5]. These X-ray detections come as the comet approaches its closest pass to Earth on Dec. 19, when it will remain safely distant at 170 million miles[6][7][8][9].\n\nThe X-ray emissions, produced when gases streaming from the comet collide with charged particles in the solar wind, allow scientists to trace elements such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen that optical telescopes struggle to detect[2][3][4]. The observations reveal interactions occurring hundreds of thousands of miles from the nucleus, marking regions where the comet's ancient material meets the high-energy environment near the Sun[1][2].",

      "description": "Astronomers have made two remarkable cosmic discoveries this week, confirming the first runaway supermassive black hole speeding through space and reporting evidence of a potential superkilonova, a never-before-seen type of stellar explosion that combines two of the universe's most powerful events.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope confirmed a supermassive black hole, at least 10 million times the mass of the Sun, traveling at 954 kilometers per second\u2014or 2.2 million miles per hour\u2014through a pair of galaxies known as the \"Cosmic Owl,\" according to research published this week[1][2]. The black hole, designated RBH-1, leaves a 200,000 light-year trail of newborn stars in its wake.\n\n\"It boggles the mind,\" said Pieter van Dokkum of Yale University, who led the discovery team[1][2]. \"The forces that are needed to dislodge such a massive black hole from its home are enormous. And yet, it was predicted that such escapes should occur.\"\n\nVan Dokkum and colleagues first spotted the streak using the Hubble Space Telescope in 2023, but JWST's near-infrared observations provided definitive proof by revealing a supersonic bow shock ahead of the black hole[3][2]. The researchers believe the black hole was ejected when two galaxies merged and their central black holes collided, with gravitational waves from the merger imparting a powerful recoil kick[2][4].",

      "description": "Gold prices held steady near all-time highs on Thursday while silver hovered close to a record and platinum extended its meteoric rise, as investors awaited key US inflation data and a wave of central bank decisions.\n\nSpot gold traded at $4,334 per ounce as of Thursday morning, roughly $50 below the record high of $4,382 reached in October[1][2]. The metal has surged 65% this year[3][4], driven by central bank purchases and investor flight from government bonds. Meanwhile, spot silver rose to $66.48 per ounce[3][2], just below its all-time high of $66.88 set on Wednesday[2][5][6], marking a stunning 130% gain for 2025[3][2].\n\nPlatinum outperformed both metals, climbing 2.9% to $1,953[3] and touching $1,977[7], its highest level since 2008[8]. The metal has surged 18% this month alone[9][8] and more than doubled in value this year[10], as banks store metal in the US to mitigate tariff risks and China's new futures exchange boosts demand[8][10].",

I've been told that on good authority.\"[1][2]\n\nThe announcement came just hours before Iran was expected to carry out the execution of Erfan Soltani, a 26-year-old shopkeeper from Fardis, west of Tehran, who was detained on January 8 and sentenced to death without access to a lawyer or trial, according to human rights groups and the U.S. State Department. Trump did not specify who provided the assurances, though Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had been in contact with Trump's top aide Steve Witkoff over the weekend.[2][3][4]",

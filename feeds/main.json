He criticized \"the falsehoods that fill the pompous speeches of those who send them to their deaths\" regarding young soldiers forced into combat[2][3].",

Graduate student Matthew Nelson discovered that unwanted photons produced during laser operations share nearly identical wavelength and waveform characteristics with the interfering laser light itself[1][3]. This similarity allows the two noise sources to be tuned to cancel each other out through destructive interference, yielding a significantly cleaner stream of single photons\u2014the fundamental units needed for photonic quantum systems[4][1][2].",

The arrangement blurs traditional dealmaking lines, reflecting a new Silicon Valley trend where tech giants cherry-pick talent and intellectual property without fully absorbing companies.\n\nCNBC reported the $20 billion valuation, citing Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led Groq's latest funding round[1]. However, neither Nvidia nor Groq confirmed financial terms. In a blog post, Groq characterized the arrangement as a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement\" for its inference technology[2]. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang clarified in an employee email obtained by CNBC that while the company is \"adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groq's IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company\"[1][3].\n\nDavis told CNBC that Nvidia is acquiring Groq's assets, excluding its cloud business[1]. Simon Edwards, formerly Groq's chief financial officer, will become CEO of the continuing entity, with GroqCloud operations uninterrupted[2][4].",

The findings, published October 13 in Nucleic Acids Research and announced by HSE University on December 23, reveal a new mechanism for understanding how gene regulation shifts in cancer cells[3][1][4].\n\nThe researchers trained an AI model called GQ-DNABERT on EndoQuad, the world's largest database of experimentally validated quadruplexes, to predict where these structures form throughout the genome[1][2].

In response, North Korea's Defense Ministry vowed to consider \"countermeasures corresponding to the U.S. nuclear muscle flexing,\" calling the submarine's presence \"a grave act of destabilization that escalates military tensions on the Korean Peninsula\"[1][11][12].",

Under the agreement, Groq founder Jonathan Ross, President Sunny Madra, and other team members will join Nvidia to help advance the licensed technology, while Simon Edwards steps into the role of CEO at Groq[3][7].",

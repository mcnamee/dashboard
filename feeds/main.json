Both trains were carrying hundreds of passengers\u2014roughly 300 on the Iryo service and around 100 to 200 on the Renfe train.[1][2][3][4]\n\nSpain's Transport Minister \u00d3scar Puente confirmed the death toll after midnight, stating that all survivors had been rescued from the wreckage.

The Iranian president also blamed Washington for his country's economic struggles, citing \"longstanding enmity and inhumane sanctions\" imposed by the United States and its allies.[1][2]\n\nPezeshkian's warning followed a sharp exchange between Trump and Khamenei on Saturday. In an interview with Politico, Trump said \"it's time to look for new leadership in Iran,\" calling the 86-year-old supreme leader \"a sick man who should run his country properly and stop killing people\". Trump added that Iran under Khamenei's rule was \"the worst place to live anywhere in the world because of poor leadership\".[3]",

Early shipments of H200s were already arriving in Hong Kong when the blockade took effect, catching Nvidia off guard, according to sources familiar with the matter.[1][2][3]",

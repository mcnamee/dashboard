The findings, published in Nature Astronomy on January 7, could improve space weather forecasting and enhance understanding of how solar flares unleash their extreme energy[1][2][3].\n\nThe discovery pinpoints a newly identified class of high-energy particles in the solar corona\u2014the sun's upper atmosphere\u2014as the origin of gamma-ray signals observed during major solar flare events. These particles, measured at energies of several million electron volts, are hundreds to thousands of times more energetic than typical flare particles and move near the speed of light[1][2][3].",

The Australian Antarctic Division announced the achievement on January 7, following the extraction of a nearly one-meter core from 151 meters depth at a remote drilling site 1,200 kilometers inland from Casey research station[1][2][3].\n\nThe breakthrough comes after seven years of designing, building, and testing the 8.4-meter drill, which is engineered to operate in extreme conditions including temperatures as low as minus 55 degrees Celsius and pressures up to 300 kilograms per square centimeter[1][2][4]. The drill, adapted from a Danish design by Australian Antarctic Division scientists and engineers, is designed to ultimately reach ice more than 3,000 meters deep at the bedrock[2][3][4].",

Nearly 40 international researchers are now racing against time to complete fieldwork that could reveal how quickly this Florida-sized glacier might contribute to global sea-level rise[1][2][3].\n\nThe 12-day voyage from New Zealand proceeded smoothly until Monday evening, when the vessel encountered an unexpectedly dense barrier of sea ice surrounding the Antarctic continent[1][4][1]. For hours, Captain Kim Gwang-heon and his crew maneuvered the 360-foot icebreaker through the frozen landscape, frequently reversing course when passages became blocked[1][3][1]. The ship groaned and shook as it collided with ice formations, creating sounds that resembled \"being inside a washing machine,\" according to The New York Times[1][1]. Captain Kim, who remained awake for more than 30 hours navigating the treacherous conditions, expressed relief when the thickest ice finally dissipated around midnight Wednesday[1][5][1]. \"We all possible for predicting conditions, it doesn't always go as planned,\" he said[1][1].",

Five years ago, a catastrophic drought turned his fertile land to dust, killing thousands of native kangaroos and forcing him to reconsider the future of his century-old family farm. Today, those same fields host part of the massive MacIntyre Wind Farm, generating power for 700,000 homes\u2014and providing Finlay with crucial supplemental income as agriculture grows increasingly unpredictable[1][2].\n\nHis story reflects a broader economic shift gaining momentum worldwide. As renewable energy costs continue their precipitous decline, a rapid transition away from fossil fuels has emerged as not just an environmental imperative, but an enormous economic opportunity. According to a University of Oxford study, transitioning to renewable energy by 2050 could save the global economy at least $12 trillion in energy system costs compared to maintaining current fossil fuel use[3][4][5].",

Secretary of State Marco Rubio told lawmakers during a classified briefing this week that purchasing the territory is the administration's preferred approach, though he plans to meet with Danish officials next week after they requested an urgent meeting[2][4].\n\nThe renewed push comes as Trump frames Greenland as essential to U.S. national security, citing increased Russian and Chinese activity in the Arctic region[5][3]. Denmark, Greenland, and seven European nations have strongly rejected the proposal, with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warning that any military action would \"mark the end of NATO\"[6].",

The move was part of a broader executive order suspending US support for 66 international organizations, agencies and commissions, according to a US official[2][5][4].",

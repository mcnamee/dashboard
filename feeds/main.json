Dmitriev told reporters late Saturday that the discussions were proceeding \"constructively\"[3][6].",

Discovered on July 1 by NASA-funded ATLAS telescopes in Chile[1][4], the seven-mile-wide comet has been tracked by multiple space agencies and observatories, including NASA's Parker Solar Probe, Hubble Space Telescope, and JUICE Jupiter probe[1][2]. The comet will pass approximately 170 million miles from Earth[6][1] before continuing its journey back into interstellar space, never to return.",

NASA coordinated an unprecedented observation campaign involving Parker Solar Probe, the James Webb Space Telescope, and Hubble, capturing detailed data from the ancient visitor that may be older than our solar system itself[2][3][4].\n\n\"The data that will come down from the spacecraft will be fresh information about a place that we, as humanity, have never been,\" said Joe Westlake, director of NASA's Heliophysics Division[5]. The comet, discovered July 1 by the ATLAS survey in Chile, exhibited a prominent ion tail as it passed perihelion on October 29 at 1.36 AU from the Sun[2][6].",

The ancient visitor, possibly more than 7 billion years old, marks only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system[2][3]. NASA's Parker Solar Probe captured observations of the comet between October and November, while the James Webb Space Telescope conducted follow-up observations in December[4][2].\n\nJust days earlier, astronomers announced the first clear detection of a black hole twisting spacetime itself. The phenomenon, called Lense-Thirring precession or \"frame dragging,\" was observed through a synchronized 20-day wobble in both X-ray and radio emissions from tidal disruption event AT2020afhd[5][6][7]. \"This is a real gift for physicists as we confirm predictions made more than a century ago,\" said Dr. Cosimo Inserra from Cardiff University[8].",

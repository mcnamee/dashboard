The voyage marks a first-of-its-kind effort to continuously lift rare-earth material from such depths to a ship.",

The unrest, which has spread to 185 cities across all 31 provinces, represents one of the most serious challenges to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's regime since the 1979 revolution[2][3].\n\nHRANA reported Sunday that more than 10,600 people have been arrested since protests erupted on December 28, when Iran's currency plummeted to historic lows against the U.S. dollar[4][1]. The agency, which has a history of accurate reporting during previous Iranian unrest, confirmed 490 protester deaths and 48 security force fatalities, though the actual toll may be higher due to a nationwide internet blackout imposed January 8[2][5].\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been briefed on military strike options for Iran and warned Tehran he would hit the regime \"very, very hard where it hurts\" if it continues killing protesters[6][7]. Iran's parliament speaker responded by threatening that U.S. troops and Israel would become \"legitimate targets\" if America intervenes militarily[8][4].",

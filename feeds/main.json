The cuts, announced Tuesday morning, represent roughly 10% of the 15,000-person division and will disproportionately impact teams working on VR headsets and Horizon Worlds, Meta's VR-based social network[1][2][3].\n\nChief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth informed affected employees via an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg, with resources being redirected toward AI-powered wearables and smartphone features[2][4]. The move signals an acknowledgment that Meta's costly metaverse vision\u2014which prompted CEO Mark Zuckerberg to rename the company from Facebook in 2021\u2014has failed to gain mainstream traction.",

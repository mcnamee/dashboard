Using satellite radar data collected between 2014 and 2023, the team found that 18 of those deltas are experiencing average annual subsidence rates that exceed the current global sea-level rise rate of about 4 millimeters per year.[1][2][3]",

The findings reveal that scientists who adopt AI publish 3.02 times as many papers and receive nearly five times as many citations as their peers who do not use AI. They also reach leadership positions about 1.5 years earlier.[1][2]\n\nYet this individual success comes at a cost to the broader scientific enterprise. AI-driven research covers 4.6% less topical territory than conventional studies and spawns 22% less engagement between papers.[2][1]",

In the period ahead, this will result in an increased military presence in and around Greenland, comprising aircraft, vessels and soldiers, including from NATO allies,\" the Danish Defense Ministry said in a statement.[1][2]",

      "description": "Iran's chief of judiciary announced on Wednesday that rapid trials and possible executions will proceed for thousands of protesters detained during nationwide demonstrations, directly challenging President Donald Trump's warning that the United States would take \"very strong action\" if the Islamic Republic begins hanging dissidents.\n\nGholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei made the statement in a video broadcast by Iranian state television, emphasizing urgency: \"If we want to do a job, we should do it now. If we want to do something, we have to do it quickly. If it becomes late, two months, three months later, it doesn't have the same effect.\"[1][2][3]\n\nThe announcement came as human rights organizations reported that Erfan Soltani, a 26-year-old clothing seller from Fardis near Tehran, was scheduled to become the first protester executed in connection with the unrest. His fate remained uncertain Wednesday, with the Hengaw Organization for Human Rights unable to confirm whether the execution had been carried out amid Iran's ongoing communications blackout.[4][5]",

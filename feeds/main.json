The photo, labeled file 468, showed a desk drawer containing multiple photographs, with Trump's image among them[7][8].\n\nDemocrats on the House Oversight Committee pointed to the missing Trump photograph in a post on X Saturday, writing: \"This photo, file 468, from the Epstein files that includes Donald Trump has apparently now been removed from the DOJ release. @AGPamBondi is this true? What else is being covered up? We need transparency for the American public\"[1][5][8].",

The development marks a significant moment in the succession planning for one of America's largest automakers.\n\nAnderson joined GM in June after working at Tesla and co-founding autonomous trucking company Aurora Innovation[2][3]. The understanding when he was hired was that successfully advancing Barra's push to bring cutting-edge software and self-driving technology to GM vehicles could position him as a potential successor[1][3], people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.",

The settlements include two\u2014Ganim and Kadim\u2014that were previously evacuated during Israel's 2005 disengagement plan[4][1][2].\n\nThe approval brings the total number of settlements from 141 in 2022 to 210, and increases the number of new settlements approved over the past two years to 69, according to Smotrich[1][2][5]. All Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are considered illegal under international law[4][1][2].",

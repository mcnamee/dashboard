The Iranian president also blamed Washington for his country's economic struggles, citing \"longstanding enmity and inhumane sanctions\" imposed by the United States and its allies.[1][2]\n\nPezeshkian's warning followed a sharp exchange between Trump and Khamenei on Saturday. In an interview with Politico, Trump said \"it's time to look for new leadership in Iran,\" calling the 86-year-old supreme leader \"a sick man who should run his country properly and stop killing people\". Trump added that Iran under Khamenei's rule was \"the worst place to live anywhere in the world because of poor leadership\".[3]",

      "description": "European Union lawmakers are poised to freeze approval of the EU-US trade deal after President Donald Trump announced tariffs on eight NATO allies Saturday in his latest bid to acquire Greenland. The move marks a dramatic escalation in transatlantic tensions, jeopardizing the landmark agreement struck just six months ago.\n\nManfred Weber, president of the European People's Party\u2014the largest political faction in the European Parliament\u2014declared that proceeding with the trade deal is no longer feasible. \"The EPP is in favor of the EU-US trade deal, but given Donald Trump's threats regarding Greenland, approval is not possible at this stage,\" Weber posted on social media Saturday, adding that \"zero tariffs on US products must now be put on hold.\"[1][2][3]",

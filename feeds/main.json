Six of eight international climate datasets ranked 2025 as the third-warmest year, while two ranked it second-warmest in the 176-year temperature record. The findings came despite the cooling influence of La Ni\u00f1a conditions at the start and end of the year.[1][2][3]\n\n\"The year 2025 started and ended with a cooling La Ni\u00f1a and yet it was still one of the warmest years on record globally because of the accumulation of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in our atmosphere,\" said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.[2][1]",

These six nations collectively represent about 75% of Latin America's population.[1][2]\n\n\"Our analysis found that the Catholic share of the population in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru has significantly declined since 2013-14, while a growing share of adults in the region are religiously unaffiliated,\" said Kirsten Lesage, a Pew research associate and the report's lead author.[3][4]",

Its location\u2014beneath the flight paths that intercontinental ballistic missiles would traverse between these nuclear powers\u2014has made the semi-autonomous Danish territory a focal point of President Donald Trump's aggressive push to acquire it for his ambitious \"Golden Dome\" missile defense initiative.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on January 21, Trump called for \"immediate negotiations\" to acquire Greenland, describing it as \"this land on which we're going to build the greatest golden dome ever built.\" He added: \"If there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice. Think of it: those missiles would be flying right over the centre.\"[1][2]",

      "description": "Astronomers this week released new images documenting two distinct celestial objects bearing the ATLAS name: one a solar system comet that fragmented after its close solar approach, and the other an interstellar visitor that continues to puzzle scientists with its unusual jet structures and delayed detection in archival data.\n\nThe Gemini North telescope in Hawaii captured high-resolution footage of Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) breaking apart, with images released Thursday showing the comet's nucleus splintering into multiple fragments following its closest approach to the Sun on October 8, 2025. Meanwhile, NASA confirmed that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS had been present in archived TESS satellite data from May 2025\u2014nearly two months before its official discovery on July 1, 2025.[1][2]",

West Texas Intermediate also declined more than 1%, dropping from the four-month highs reached Thursday.[1][2]\n\n\"President Trump's readiness to consider diplomacy with Iran appears to make a U.S. military action less probable than it was yesterday,\" said Tamas Varga, an analyst at PVM Oil Associates.[2]",

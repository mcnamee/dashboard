The warning came as human rights groups reported at least 39 to 45 protesters have been killed since demonstrations erupted in late December, including eight minors[4][5][6][7].\n\nThe protests, which began December 28 at Tehran's Grand Bazaar over economic grievances, have spread to all 31 provinces[4][8]. Violence intensified on Thursday evening after exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi called for coordinated demonstrations at 8 p.m. local time[9][5].

The statement came as U.N. officials said they learned of the withdrawal through news reports and White House social media posts Wednesday, with no formal notification from the Trump administration[1][2].\n\nThe executive order, which followed a yearlong review, targets organizations the White House says promote \"radical climate policies, global governance, and ideological programs that conflict with U.S. sovereignty and economic strength\"[6][7][8]. Among the 31 U.N. entities are the U.N. Population Fund, which provides reproductive health services in more than 150 countries, and UN Women, which promotes gender equality[1][2][9]. The order also directs withdrawal from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, the 1992 treaty that underpins the Paris climate agreement[6][1][2].\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio defended the move in a statement, saying the Trump administration determined the organizations were \"redundant, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run\" or advancing agendas inconsistent with U.S. interests[10][11][12]. The White House said the withdrawals would end American taxpayer funding for entities \"that advance globalist agendas over U.S. priorities\"[6][13][9].",

      "description": "President Donald Trump's renewed push to acquire Greenland intensified this week as U.S. officials discussed offering direct payments to residents and Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced plans to meet with Danish officials next week. The White House confirmed Wednesday that Trump and his national security team are \"actively discussing\" what a potential purchase would look like[1][2], despite firm rejections from both Denmark and Greenland.\n\nAccording to four sources familiar with White House deliberations, U.S. officials have discussed sending lump-sum payments ranging from $10,000 to $100,000 per person to Greenland's 57,000 residents to encourage them to secede from Denmark and potentially join the United States[3][2]. At the upper end, such payments would total nearly $6 billion. The administration is also exploring a Compact of Free Association, similar to agreements with Pacific island nations, which would require Greenland to first become independent from Denmark[3][2].\n\nTrump has justified his interest by citing national security concerns and the island's strategic Arctic location. \"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark isn't going to be able to do it,\" Trump told reporters Sunday[4][2]. The administration has not ruled out military intervention, though officials say they prefer diplomatic or economic means[1][5].",

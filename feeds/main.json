      "description": "The anti-government protests convulsing Iran since late December are rooted not only in economic collapse and political repression but in a deeper, environmental catastrophe that has reached an inflection point. Dwindling water supplies, poisonous air, and crumbling infrastructure have compelled Iranians to take to the streets in the deadliest uprising the country has seen in decades.\n\nA new analysis published this week by Nima Shokri of the United Nations University reveals a pattern: protests are more likely to erupt in areas suffering from groundwater depletion, land subsidence, and water rationing. Provinces such as Tehran, Khuzestan in the southwest, and Isfahan in central Iran, all regions with high levels of protest, are grappling with acute water shortages and disputes over access.[1][2][3]",

      "description": "Researchers at Tohoku University have detailed how artificial intelligence agents are transforming the search for solid electrolytes, the materials essential for building safer and more efficient solid-state batteries. A review published in the journal AI Agent outlines how these software-based systems are moving beyond simple predictions to coordinate entire research workflows, from data analysis to experimental planning.\n\nSolid-state batteries have emerged as a leading candidate for the future of energy storage, particularly for electric vehicles and large-scale renewable systems. Unlike conventional lithium-ion batteries that rely on flammable liquid electrolytes, solid-state batteries use solid materials to transport ions, offering advantages in safety, energy density, and long-term reliability.[1][2][3]",

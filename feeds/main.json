      "description": "President Donald Trump has dispatched a substantial U.S. naval fleet to the Persian Gulf in an escalating standoff with Iran, warning Tehran on Thursday that \"time is running out\" to negotiate a nuclear agreement or face military action he described as \"far worse\" than the June 2025 strikes that targeted Iranian nuclear facilities.\n\nThe deployment, which Trump has repeatedly called a \"massive Armada,\" is led by the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and now includes at least six guided-missile destroyers in the region, with the USS Delbert D. Black crossing into the Red Sea on January 29 and docking at Israel's port of Eilat on Friday. The carrier strike group entered the Middle East region on January 26 after departing the South China Sea earlier this month.[1][2][3][4]",

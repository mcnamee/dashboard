The dollar strengthened to its highest level in two weeks while oil prices remained surprisingly stable, defying expectations of significant market turbulence.\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index climbed 0.3% to reach its strongest level since December 22, as the greenback outperformed nearly all major currencies[1][2]. The Mexican peso declined 0.7%, and the euro dropped 0.3%[2]. However, the overall market response suggested investors were treating the geopolitical shock as a contained event rather than a systemic crisis.",

Deutsche Bank projects AI data center capital expenditure could reach $4 trillion by 2030[1][2][3], while Morgan Stanley strategist Andrew Sheets notes that \"costs are going up not down in our forecast, because there's inflation in chip costs and inflation in power costs\"[1][2][4].\n\n\"What keeps us awake at night is that inflation risk has resurfaced,\" said Julius Bendikas, European head of economics and dynamic asset allocation at Mercer, which manages $683 billion in assets[1][2]. Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management, warned that while he continues holding tech stocks for now, he \"would not be surprised to see inflation booming worldwide by the end of 2026\"[5][2].",

      "description": "Global stock markets climbed Monday as investors absorbed the dramatic weekend US military operation in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, with traders weighing geopolitical risks against potential long-term economic opportunities[1][2][3].\n\nUS stock futures rose in early trading, with the S&P 500 gaining 0.2%, the Nasdaq 100 jumping 0.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average edging up 0.1%[1][2]. European markets also advanced, with London's FTSE 100 rising 0.2%, Germany's DAX climbing 1%, and France's CAC 40 up 0.6%[3].\n\nThe subdued market reaction reflected analysts' assessment that Venezuela's limited oil production\u2014currently below 1 million barrels per day, or less than 1% of global supply\u2014constrains the potential for major disruptions[1][3][4]. \"Venezuela accounts for less than 1% of global oil, and at best a political outcome restoring production will take years,\" said Lale Akoner, a global market analyst at eToro[3].\n\nGold prices surged 2.3% to $4,433.71 per ounce as investors sought safe-haven assets amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty[3][5][6]. Meanwhile, oil futures fluctuated in early trading, with Brent crude falling 0.4% to $60.60 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate declining 0.5% to $56.97[3][7].",

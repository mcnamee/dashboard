Scientists warn that if Greenland's massive ice sheet were to fully melt, global sea levels could rise by approximately seven meters.[1][2][3]",

      "description": "Gold surged to an unprecedented high just shy of $5,000 an ounce on Friday, as escalating geopolitical tensions and a weakening dollar propelled the precious metal toward a historic milestone. Spot gold rose to a record $4,967.48 per ounce, marking a nearly 15% gain since the start of 2026 and extending a rally that saw the metal climb roughly 64% last year.[1][2][3]\n\nThe rally gained fresh momentum after President Donald Trump announced that a \"massive\" U.S. naval force is heading toward Iran, reigniting Middle East tensions that had briefly cooled following his retreat from Greenland tariff threats. \"We have an armada. We have a massive fleet heading in that direction, and maybe we won't have to use it,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One returning from the World Economic Forum in Davos.[4][5][6]",

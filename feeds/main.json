Trump told reporters the U.S. would \"run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\"[3][1].\n\nYet on Sunday morning talk shows, Rubio walked back those assertions. \"People keep fixating on that,\" he told NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" clarifying that the U.S. would continue enforcing an oil quarantine to press for policy changes rather than governing Venezuela day-to-day[1][2]. \"We expect to see changes in Venezuela,\" Rubio said, adding the U.S. would use control of sanctioned oil as \"tremendous leverage\"[2].",

      "description": "Allowing overfished coral reef populations to recover could boost sustainable seafood yields by nearly 50 percent and help feed millions worldwide, according to research published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences[1][2][3].\n\nScientists at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama and collaborators analyzed 1,211 reef sites across 23 jurisdictions, finding that depleted fish stocks produce far less food than their sustainable potential[4][5]. The study, led by Jessica Zamborain-Mason of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, calculated that recovery could generate between 20,000 and 162 million additional sustainable fish servings per country annually\u2014enough to meet recommended seafood intake for up to 1.4 million additional people per year[6][1][5].\n\n\"Our study quantifies how much is being lost by having overfished reef fish communities in terms of food provisioning and, in turn, how much could be gained from rebuilding reef fish stocks and managing them at sustainable levels,\" Zamborain-Mason said[6][1][4].",

Beijing condemned the action as a clear violation of international law and urged Washington to stop efforts to topple the Venezuelan government[1][2][3][4].\n\n\"China expresses grave concern over the U.S. forcibly seizing President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife and taking them out of the country,\" the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted Sunday on its website[5][6][7]. \"The U.S.'s move is in clear violation of international law, basic norms in international relations, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.\"\n\nThis marks Beijing's second statement since Saturday, when President Donald Trump announced that US forces had captured Maduro and his wife during what officials called Operation Absolute Resolve[8][9]. The military operation involved more than 150 aircraft striking Venezuelan military installations and disabling the country's air defenses before special forces extracted Maduro from Caracas[9][10].",

The coordinated denunciations highlighted deep divisions over President Donald Trump's intervention, with even traditional American allies expressing alarm about violations of international law.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi condemned the operation as \"a clear instance of state terrorism\" during a phone call with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil Pinto on Saturday[1][2][3][4]. Iran's Foreign Ministry called the action \"a flagrant violation\" of Venezuela's sovereignty and territorial integrity, urging the United Nations to take immediate action[5][6][7]. The statement emphasized that the US military aggression breached fundamental principles of the UN Charter, particularly Article 2(4) which prohibits the use of force[8][5].",

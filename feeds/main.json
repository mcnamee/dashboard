Speaking to 200 journalists and analysts at a Las Vegas hotel during the technology conference, Huang estimated the global labor shortage at \"tens of millions\" of workers due to aging populations and demographic decline[1][2][3].\n\n\"Having robots will create jobs,\" Huang said. \"We need more AI immigrants to help us on manufacturing floors and do work that maybe we've decided not to do anymore\"[1][2][3]. The leader of the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalization of roughly $3.5 trillion, dismissed fears that automation would eliminate human employment, instead predicting a \"robotics revolution\" that would boost economies and expand hiring[1][2][3][4].",

The discoveries, presented at the 247th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Phoenix, show that even when heavy elements were scarce, stars improvised to forge solid dust grains[5].",

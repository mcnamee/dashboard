However, due to an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court in 2024, Netanyahu could not travel to Switzerland. With Herzog already attending the World Economic Forum, senior U.S. officials twice approached the Prime Minister's Office on Tuesday and Wednesday, proposing that Herzog sit on stage alongside Arab and Muslim leaders and sign the board's charter, according to Israel's Channel 12.[1][2][3][4]",

If approved, the mini-satellite would position itself within the Moon's shadow roughly once every 29.6 days, creating total eclipse conditions lasting up to 48 minutes\u2014ten times longer than typical eclipses observed from Earth.[1][2][3][4]",

      "description": "A new benchmark designed to push the limits of artificial intelligence has been formally published in the journal Nature, revealing that even the most advanced AI systems score below 40% on questions that probe the frontier of human knowledge.\n\n\"Humanity's Last Exam\" comprises 2,500 expert-level questions spanning more than 100 academic subfields, from interpreting ancient Palmyrene script on Roman tombstones to analyzing hummingbird skeletal structures. The benchmark represents a global collaboration of nearly 1,000 professors and researchers from over 500 institutions across 50 countries, including contributors from KAIST and Yonsei University in South Korea.[1][2]",

Meanwhile, southeastern Australia has recorded temperatures approaching 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit), setting all-time records across multiple states.[1][2][3]",

The diplomatic strain comes just days after the United States officially exited the Paris Agreement, further isolating the country from global climate efforts.\n\nRoss Virginia, a professor emeritus of environmental studies at Dartmouth College, said a climate program he ran with Greenlandic colleagues was halted by \"mutual agreement\" due to the tensions, according to Bloomberg News. \"Direct cooperation is paused while we determine what a future vision for collaborative science diplomacy \u2014 particularly involving education and younger students \u2014 could look like,\" he said.[1][2][3]\n\nAnother US scientist, speaking anonymously for fear of jeopardizing relationships, said some research partnerships had been affected by the political climate.[3][1]",

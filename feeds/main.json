The ancient visitor, possibly more than 7 billion years old, marks only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system[2][3]. NASA's Parker Solar Probe captured observations of the comet between October and November, while the James Webb Space Telescope conducted follow-up observations in December[4][2].\n\nJust days earlier, astronomers announced the first clear detection of a black hole twisting spacetime itself. The phenomenon, called Lense-Thirring precession or \"frame dragging,\" was observed through a synchronized 20-day wobble in both X-ray and radio emissions from tidal disruption event AT2020afhd[5][6][7]. \"This is a real gift for physicists as we confirm predictions made more than a century ago,\" said Dr. Cosimo Inserra from Cardiff University[8].",

The receiving drone autonomously located, tracked and docked with a tanker aircraft during high-speed formation flights using a vision-based navigation system that achieved a 99% detection success rate with centimeter-level positioning accuracy[2][2].\n\nThe development gains significance from Northwestern Polytechnical University's direct involvement with China's Jiu Tian drone program[1][2][1]. The heavy-duty unmanned platform, which completed its maiden flight on December 11 in Shaanxi Province[3][4][5], can carry more than 200 loitering munitions and has an official range of 7,000 kilometers[1][1]. Combined with in-flight refueling capabilities, its effective strike radius could double to approximately 14,000 kilometers, placing Washington, New York and Miami within plausible reach[1][1][2].",

      "description": "Engineers at the University of Leicester have unveiled a design framework for magnetic cloaking devices that can shield electronics from disruptive magnetic fields, marking the first practical approach for objects of any shape. The research, published December 18 in Science Advances, offers potential applications from medical imaging to fusion energy[1][2][3].\n\nLed by Dr. Harold Ruiz from Leicester's School of Engineering, the team developed a physics-informed optimization framework that solves Maxwell's equations to design magnetic cloaks for arbitrarily shaped structures[1][2]. Previous magnetic cloaking demonstrations were restricted to simple cylinders or spheres, limiting real-world applicability[1][2][3].\n\nThe devices work by manipulating magnetic field lines to flow around objects as if they weren't there, making the cloaked object magnetically invisible while leaving surrounding fields undisturbed[2][3]. The design combines two materials with opposing magnetic properties: an inner superconducting layer that repels magnetic fields and an outer soft ferromagnetic layer that attracts them, creating a balanced effect that eliminates field distortion[1][2][3].",

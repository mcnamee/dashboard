The deal, which the White House was set to announce Thursday, places Taiwan on equal footing with Japan and South Korea, which secured similar arrangements last year.[1][2]\n\nUnder the agreement, Taiwanese semiconductor companies will commit to a $500 billion increase in financing for American operations, with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. pledging to build at least five additional fabrication plants in Arizona, effectively doubling its manufacturing presence in the state.[2][3][1]",

The threat came as European nations deployed military personnel to the semiautonomous Danish territory for joint exercises, and a bipartisan delegation of U.S. lawmakers arrived in Copenhagen to demonstrate solidarity with Denmark.[1][2][3]",

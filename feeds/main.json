The talks, if they lead to a deal, would be one of the largest private financings ever for an AI company and would further entangle the world\u2019s biggest technology suppliers in the scramble for computing power and market share in generative AI.[1][2][3]\n\nThe negotiations are ongoing and terms could change, and Reuters said it could not immediately verify The Information\u2019s reporting. Still, the report fits a widening fundraising push around OpenAI that has drawn in major strategic backers and deep pools of global capital.[3][1]",

Venezuela, which supplied roughly a third of Cuba's oil at approximately 26,500 barrels per day in 2025, has not shipped any crude or fuel to the Caribbean island since early January.[1][2][3]",

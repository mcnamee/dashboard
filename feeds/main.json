      "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a landmark trade agreement on Friday in Beijing, with Canada agreeing to slash tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles in exchange for China reducing duties on Canadian agricultural products, marking a dramatic shift in Ottawa's trade policy away from the United States.\n\nUnder the deal, Canada will allow up to 49,000 Chinese EVs into the country at a 6.1% tariff rate, replacing the 100% duty imposed by former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2024. The quota will increase to 70,000 vehicles over five years. In return, China will lower tariffs on Canadian canola seed from approximately 84% to 15% by March 1, according to statements from both governments.[1][2][3][4][5][6]",

The burned area in the North American Arctic has roughly doubled compared to the mid-20th century, and the mid-2010s ushered in what scientists describe as a novel fire regime.[1][2][3]\n\n\"Fire has always been a part of boreal and Arctic landscapes, but now it's starting to act in more extreme ways that mimic what we've seen in the temperate and the tropical areas,\" said Jessica McCarty, Deputy Earth Science Division Chief at NASA's Ames Research Center and lead author of a 2025 Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme report.[4][1]",

A Washington source close to the administration told The Independent that strikes could be imminent. \"President Trump is ready to push the button on Iran,\" the source said. \"It will be a surgical removal of the regime.\"[3][4]",

      "description": "Astronomers presented two groundbreaking discoveries this week at the 247th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Phoenix, unveiling celestial objects that challenge prevailing theories about how galaxies form and evolve.\n\nUsing NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, researchers confirmed the first-ever detection of a starless dark matter cloud dubbed Cloud-9, located 14 million light-years from Earth near the spiral galaxy Messier 94[1][2][3][4][5][6]. The object represents a category called Reionization-Limited H I Clouds, or RELHICs\u2014theoretical \"failed galaxies\" that never accumulated enough gas to ignite star formation[1][2][3][7][8][9].\n\n\"This is a tale of a failed galaxy,\" said Alejandro Benitez-Llambay, an astrophysicist at the University of Milano-Bicocca in Milan, Italy, who serves as the study's principal investigator[1][10][11]. The findings, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters in November 2025, were presented Monday at the conference[1][8][11].\n\nCloud-9's core spans roughly 4,900 light-years and contains about one million solar masses of neutral hydrogen gas[1][3][8]. Yet calculations suggest the cloud sits within a dark matter halo weighing approximately five billion solar masses\u2014mass that provides gravitational structure without producing visible light[1][3][12].\n\n\"Cloud-9 gives us a rare look at a dark-matter-dominated cloud,\" said Andrew Fox, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute for the European Space Agency[1][3][13].\n\nThe discovery began three years ago when China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope detected the hydrogen cloud during a radio survey[1][2][3][4][14][15]. Subsequent observations from the Green Bank Telescope and Very Large Array confirmed the gas presence, but only Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys could definitively rule out stars[1][3][4][8][13].\n\n\"Before we used Hubble, you could argue that this is a faint dwarf galaxy that we could not see with ground-based telescopes,\" said lead author Gagandeep Anand of the Space Telescope Science Institute[3][13][12]. \"But with Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys, we're able to nail down that there's nothing there.\"",

      "description": "The richest 1 percent of the world's population exhausted their annual carbon emissions allowance just 10 days into 2026, according to research released by Oxfam on January 10. The finding underscores growing concerns about climate inequality as governments face mounting pressure to impose wealth taxes and restrict luxury carbon consumption.\n\nOxfam designated January 10 as \"Pollutocrat Day,\" the date when the wealthiest exceeded safe emission limits needed to keep global warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, as outlined in the Paris Agreement[1]. The analysis, using data from the Stockholm Environment Institute, found the richest 1 percent emit 75.1 tonnes of carbon dioxide per person annually, or 0.206 tonnes daily[1]. In stark contrast, someone from the poorest half of the global population would take nearly three years to use their carbon allowance[2][3].\n\nThe ultra-wealthy crossed this threshold even faster. The richest 0.1 percent depleted their annual budget by January 3, just three days into the new year[4][1].",

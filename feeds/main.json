      "description": "Since the James Webb Space Telescope began operations in late 2021, one of its most perplexing discoveries has been hundreds of tiny, unexplained red points scattered throughout images of the early universe. Now, researchers from the University of Copenhagen have cracked the mystery: these \"little red dots\" are young supermassive black holes hidden within dense cocoons of ionized gas.\n\nThe findings, published Wednesday in Nature, reveal that these enigmatic objects are far less massive than scientists initially believed\u2014about 100 times smaller\u2014yet still weigh up to 10 million times the mass of our Sun.[1][2]",

      "description": "Nearly half of the world's largest river deltas, including the Nile, Ganges, and Mekong, are sinking faster than global sea levels are rising, according to new research published Wednesday in Nature. The study warns that more than 236 million people face heightened flooding risk as human-caused land subsidence emerges as the dominant threat to these coastal regions.\n\nThe research, led by scientists at the University of California, Irvine and Virginia Tech, provides the first high-resolution, delta-wide assessment of elevation loss across 40 major river deltas spanning five continents. Using satellite radar data collected between 2014 and 2023, the team found that 18 of those deltas are experiencing average annual subsidence rates that exceed the current global sea-level rise rate of about 4 millimeters per year.[1][2][3]",

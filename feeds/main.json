The method achieves this in approximately 100 microseconds, several times faster than existing approaches.[1][2][3]\n\nMeanwhile, scientists at TU Wien in Vienna and Rice University revealed Tuesday in Nature Physics that they observed an \"emergent topological semimetal\" \u2014 a quantum state previously considered impossible because it combines two phenomena thought to be incompatible.[4][5][6]",

      "description": "A team of international scientists has produced the most comprehensive map yet of Antarctica's concealed terrain, revealing thousands of previously unknown hills, ridges, and river channels buried beneath miles of ice. The breakthrough, published Thursday in the journal Science, could transform researchers' ability to predict how the frozen continent will respond to climate change and contribute to rising sea levels.[1][2][3]\n\nThe map uncovers geological features spanning 2 to 30 kilometers beneath the ice sheet, which covers more than 5.4 million square miles. Among the discoveries are deep alpine valleys, extensive channels carved by ancient flowing water that stretch for hundreds of kilometers, and sharp transitions between highland and lowland terrain that may indicate tectonic boundaries.[4][3][1]",

      "description": "The third known interstellar object to visit our solar system continues to puzzle astronomers as it exits toward Jupiter, displaying sunward jets that defy conventional comet physics while yielding no detectable alien signals to radio telescopes scanning for signs of extraterrestrial technology.\n\nComet 3I/ATLAS, first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey in Chile, has been the subject of intense scientific scrutiny since its discovery. With the Breakthrough Listen project confirming no technosignatures were detected during five hours of observation using the Green Bank Telescope on December 18, 2025, researchers have largely settled the question of whether this cosmic wanderer might be artificial.[1][2][3]\n\n\"We all would have been thrilled to find technosignatures coming from 3I/ATLAS, but they're just not there,\" Benjamin Jacobson-Bell from the University of California, Berkeley, told Space.com. \"Finding no signals was the result we expected, due to the significant evidence for 3I/ATLAS being a comet with only natural features.\"[4]",

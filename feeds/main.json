The rare cosmic object has exhibited unpredictable trajectory changes and unusual features that challenge standard comet models, intensifying calls for the release of raw observational data[3][4].\n\nIn late December, astronomers observed that 3I/ATLAS had deviated from its predicted path due to non-gravitational acceleration\u2014forces not accounted for by gravity alone[3][5]. According to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, the comet experienced a \"radial acceleration away from the Sun of 1.1x10^{-6} au per day squared,\" which would require the object to have shed approximately 13 percent of its total mass during its October perihelion passage[5][6]. However, such a massive gas cloud has not been detected, leaving the acceleration mechanism unexplained[7].",

Since the EU's petroleum products ban took effect in February 2023 through early 2024, Europe imported \u20ac3.1 billion worth of oil products from three Turkish ports with no refining facilities, while 86% of those ports' imports came from Russia during the same period, according to research by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air[2][4][3].\n\nThe findings underscore the challenge Europe faces in severing energy ties with Moscow despite ambitious targets. On December 3, EU lawmakers reached a deal to ban all Russian gas imports by autumn 2027, marking what European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called \"the dawn of a new era, the era of Europe's full energy independence from Russia\"[5][6][7][8]. The agreement prohibits Russian liquefied natural gas by end of 2026 and pipeline gas by September 2027[5][9].",

The spacecraft bus was completed in January 2025, with the mission now targeting a January 5, 2026 launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, according to the mission's principal investigator[1].\n\nThe $20 million mission represents NASA's latest effort to identify potentially habitable worlds beyond our solar system, focusing on detecting water vapor and other biosignatures in the atmospheres of at least 20 known exoplanets[1][2]. Funded under NASA's Astrophysics Pioneers program, which emphasizes small, ambitious missions with tight budget constraints, Pandora aims to complement observations from the James Webb Space Telescope by addressing a persistent challenge in exoplanet research: separating the light signatures of planets from those of their host stars[1][3].",

The assault damaged residential buildings across seven districts and sparked multiple fires, forcing emergency evacuations from a university dormitory and a nursing home[5][2].\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported that approximately one-third of the city's more than 3 million residents lost heat as temperatures hovered near freezing[6][3][7]. \"Almost a third of the capital is now without heat supply. There is no electricity in some areas of the left bank,\" Klitschko stated on Telegram[7].

      "description": "Oil prices edged lower on Sunday despite the weekend capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by US forces, as analysts said ample global supply would cushion any disruption from the oil-producing nation. Brent crude fell 22 cents to $60.53 per barrel, while US crude dropped 31 cents to $57.01[1].\n\nThe modest market reaction followed President Donald Trump's announcement Saturday that the United States would control Venezuela until an orderly transition could be arranged, after executing what he called a \"large-scale strike\" on the capital Caracas in the early hours of January 3[2][3]. Trump emphasized that securing US investments in Venezuela's oil sector was a primary goal, stating American oil companies were prepared to invest billions of dollars to restore production[1].",

Trump told reporters the U.S. would \"run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\"[3][1].\n\nYet on Sunday morning talk shows, Rubio walked back those assertions. \"People keep fixating on that,\" he told NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" clarifying that the U.S. would continue enforcing an oil quarantine to press for policy changes rather than governing Venezuela day-to-day[1][2]. \"We expect to see changes in Venezuela,\" Rubio said, adding the U.S. would use control of sanctioned oil as \"tremendous leverage\"[2].",

      "description": "Iran, Russia, China, and a coalition of Latin American nations issued sharp rebukes of the US military operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Saturday, fracturing the international community over questions of sovereignty and legal authority. The coordinated denunciations highlighted deep divisions over President Donald Trump's intervention, with even traditional American allies expressing alarm about violations of international law.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi condemned the operation as \"a clear instance of state terrorism\" during a phone call with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil Pinto on Saturday[1][2][3][4]. Iran's Foreign Ministry called the action \"a flagrant violation\" of Venezuela's sovereignty and territorial integrity, urging the United Nations to take immediate action[5][6][7]. The statement emphasized that the US military aggression breached fundamental principles of the UN Charter, particularly Article 2(4) which prohibits the use of force[8][5].",

The protests, which began December 28 among bazaar merchants in Tehran, have spread to over 170 locations across 25 of Iran's 31 provinces as of January 4[1][3].\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei addressed the unrest Saturday, calling protesters' economic concerns \"valid\" while warning that \"rioters must be put in their place\"[4][5]. His remarks followed President Trump's Friday statement on Truth Social pledging U.S. support if Iran \"violently kills peaceful protesters,\" declaring Washington was \"locked and loaded and ready to go\"[6][7]. Iranian officials immediately warned against any U.S. interference, with a senior advisor to Khamenei stating that \"the hand that comes to Iran's interior under any pretext will be cut off before it can act\"[7].",

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that an oil \"quarantine\" will remain the primary tool to pressure the country's new leadership.\n\nThe operation, codenamed \"Operation Absolute Resolve,\" began around 2:01 a.m. local time Saturday when Delta Force commandos raided Maduro's heavily fortified compound in Caracas[1][2][3]. More than 150 aircraft from 20 bases supported the mission, which transported Maduro to New York where he faces drug trafficking charges dating to 2020[2][4][5].\n\nAt least 40 people were killed in the strikes, including civilians and military personnel, according to a Venezuelan official who spoke to The New York Times[6][7]. President Trump said several US service members were injured but none were killed[8][6].",

Yet the mysterious visitor continues to captivate astronomers with unusual features that challenge conventional understanding of comets.\n\nOn December 18, one day before the object's closest approach to Earth, the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia scanned 3I/ATLAS across radio frequencies from 1 to 12 gigahertz[3][4][5]. The search, conducted by a team led by astronomer Ben Jacobson-Bell of the University of California, Berkeley, initially flagged 471,198 potential signals[4][6]. After filtering out interference, nine candidates remained\u2014all of which were traced to human-made radio noise on Earth[2][4].\n\n\"No artificial radio emission localized to 3I/ATLAS was detected,\" the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute confirmed[1][2][7]. The telescope was sensitive enough to detect transmitters as weak as 100 milliwatts, roughly the power of a mobile phone[8][3].",

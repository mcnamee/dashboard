The rocket's first stage performed normally, but telemetry data showed hydrogen tank pressure in the second stage began dropping during the first stage burn, JAXA executive Masashi Okada told reporters[1][2]. Whether the satellite separated from the rocket or where it ended up remains unknown[1][2].\n\nHours later, South Korean company Innospace's Hanbit-Nano rocket lifted off from Brazil's Alcantara Space Center at 10:13 p.m. local time but crashed approximately 30 seconds after liftoff[3][5][6][7]. The vehicle initially followed its planned vertical trajectory before an anomaly caused it to fall to the ground within a pre-designated safety zone, with no reported casualties[5][7][8]. The rocket was carrying eight payloads, including five satellites for undisclosed customers from Brazil and India[3][5][9].",

The move comes after the U.S. intercepted the Skipper and Centuries tankers in the Caribbean Sea, both fully loaded with Venezuelan crude, and pursued a third empty vessel approaching Venezuela's coast[1][3][4].\n\nMore than a dozen oil cargoes remain stuck in Venezuelan waters as ship owners hesitate to depart following Trump's announcement of a \"total and complete blockade\" of all sanctioned vessels[3][4][5].

The observations, made in February 2023 using JWST's NIRSpec instrument, revealed gas spread between 0.5 and 10 astronomical units from the star\u2014the region where Earth-like planets typically form[3][2].\n\n\"The discovery of warm, fluorescent gas in a debris disk is the first such detection ever made,\" wrote lead author Cicero Lu of the Gemini Observatory and colleagues in the paper[1][2]. The team found the gas exhibited a vibrational temperature of 8,800 Kelvin while its rotational temperature reached only 450 Kelvin near the star, indicating the molecules were out of thermal equilibrium and excited by ultraviolet radiation[3][2].",

      "description": "Computational astrophysicists have achieved a major milestone in black hole research, creating the most realistic simulations of how matter falls into black holes while emitting intense radiation, according to a study published this week in The Astrophysical Journal. The work coincides with recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope showing evidence of \"monster stars\" that may explain how supermassive black holes formed in the early universe.\n\nThe simulation breakthrough, led by Lizhong Zhang from the Institute for Advanced Study and the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Astrophysics, represents the first time scientists have modeled black hole accretion in full general relativity without using simplifying approximations[1][2][3][4]. Using two of the world's most powerful supercomputers \u2014 Frontier at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Aurora at Argonne National Laboratory \u2014 the team tracked how matter spirals into stellar mass black holes, forming turbulent disks, launching powerful winds, and sometimes producing jets[2][3].\n\n\"This is the first time we've been able to see what happens when the most important physical processes in black hole accretion are included accurately,\" Zhang said[1][2][3]. The simulated light spectra closely matched observations from real systems, from ultraluminous X-ray sources to X-ray binaries, providing confidence in the model's accuracy[2][3].",

      "description": "A multinational research team has uncovered the world's deepest known gas hydrate cold seep at 3,640 meters beneath the Greenland Sea, revealing an ecosystem thriving in conditions once thought inhospitable to complex life. The Freya Hydrate Mounds, published this week in Nature Communications, extend the known depth limit for such formations by nearly 1,800 meters[1][2][3][4].\n\nThe discovery was made during the Ocean Census Arctic Deep\u2013EXTREME24 expedition in May 2024 on the Molloy Ridge, using the remotely operated vehicle Aurora to explore the seafloor beneath massive methane gas plumes[2][3][4]. Scientists from UiT - The Arctic University of Norway led the expedition, documenting three hydrate mounds, collapse features, and dense communities of chemosynthetic organisms that survive without sunlight[1][5][2].\n\n\"This discovery rewrites the playbook for Arctic deep-sea ecosystems and carbon cycling,\" said Giuliana Panieri, professor at UiT and Chief Scientist of the expedition. \"We found an ultra-deep system that is both geologically dynamic and biologically rich, with implications for biodiversity, climate processes, and future stewardship of the High North\"[2][3].",

      "description": "Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has affirmed that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is \"most likely natural,\" tempering months of speculation about extraterrestrial technology while simultaneously proposing an unconventional use for such cosmic visitors: delivering humanity's messages to the stars[1][2][3].\n\nIn a paper published December 21 on Medium, Loeb outlined how interstellar objects could serve as faster messengers than humanity's current efforts, dramatically reducing the time needed to send artifacts beyond our solar system[1][4]. The timing of Loeb's proposal came just two days after 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, passing within 168 million miles of our planet[5][6].\n\n\"Riding 3I/ATLAS offers the benefit of reaching interstellar space by the year ~10,000 CE instead of the year ~30,000 CE,\" Loeb wrote, comparing the comet's trajectory to NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft[1][4]. The Voyager probe, launched in 1977, travels at 17 kilometers per second and will require another 28,000 years to reach the assumed edge of the solar system, according to Loeb's calculations[1]. In contrast, 3I/ATLAS moves at 60 kilometers per second, cutting the journey time by more than two-thirds[1].",

Current models under discussion focus on a 16-team league with 12 permanent members and four qualification spots, earned through FIBA\u2019s Basketball Champions League or a postseason tournament.[6][1][5][2] All clubs playing in FIBA-affiliated European leagues would have a theoretical path into the new competition.[6][1][5]\n\nFIBA secretary general Andreas Zagklis said the format \u201crespects European sport model principles by offering any ambitious club in the continent a fair pathway to the top,\u201d while NBA commissioner Adam Silver described the initiative as \u201can enormous opportunity\u201d to grow the professional game in Europe.[6][1][2][3]",

The assault followed a pattern that has intensified throughout 2025, with Russia deploying approximately 5,500 Shahed-type drones monthly against Ukrainian targets[6].",

Meanwhile, observations from the James Webb Space Telescope suggest that mysterious \"little red dots\" discovered in the distant universe are actually \"black hole stars\"\u2014supermassive black holes wrapped in dense gas envelopes that glow like giant stars\u2014according to analysis published today in New Scientist[4].",

      "description": "Chinese car manufacturers are poised to claim the top spot in worldwide vehicle sales for the first time in 2025, ending Japan's dominance that has spanned more than two decades[1]. The historic shift comes as BYD prepares to overtake Tesla in electric vehicle sales, while Chinese brands collectively expand their global footprint through aggressive exports and competitive pricing.\n\nBYD had sold 2.07 million electric vehicles by the end of November 2025, positioning the Shenzhen-based automaker to surpass Tesla as the world's largest EV seller for the year[2][3][4]. Tesla, which delivered 1.22 million battery electric vehicles through the third quarter, is projected to reach approximately 1.65 million units for the full year, marking a 7.7% decline[2][3]. The American automaker's sales received a temporary boost in the third quarter from buyers rushing to claim a $7,500 US tax credit before it expired in September, but analysts forecast fourth-quarter sales will drop to around 449,000 units[3].",

The operation will deploy autonomous underwater vehicles capable of reaching depths exceeding 6,000 meters\u2014technology unavailable during earlier search efforts[5][6].\n\nThe Boeing 777 disappeared from radar on March 8, 2014, during a routine flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing[1][2][4]. The aircraft carried 227 passengers, predominantly Chinese nationals, along with 12 Malaysian crew members[5][2][3]. Military radar later revealed the plane had deviated sharply from its flight path, turning back over northern Malaysia before heading into the Andaman Sea and then southward, after which all contact was lost[5][7][3].",

The president offered no immediate commitment, though both leaders described the two-hour meeting as productive and suggested progress toward ending the nearly four-year full-scale war.",

Ukraine has not responded to the claims.\n\nThe announcement comes one day after U.S. President Donald Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Mar-a-Lago, where both leaders expressed cautious optimism about reaching a peace deal to end the nearly four-year war. Trump said the parties were \"getting a lot closer, maybe very close\" to an agreement, while Zelenskyy reported that a 20-point peace plan was \"90 percent agreed upon\"[4][5].",

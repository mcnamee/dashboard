The operation, which CNN first reported, targeted a remote dock on Venezuela's coast that US officials believed was used by the Tren de Aragua gang to store and transport narcotics[1][2][5]. No casualties were reported as the facility was empty at the time of the strike[1][2][6].\n\nTrump initially revealed the attack during a radio interview on December 26, saying the US had destroyed a \"big facility where the ships come from\" two nights earlier, placing the strike around December 24[7][8]. When pressed by reporters about whether the CIA or military conducted the operation, Trump declined to provide details. \"I know exactly who it was, but I don't want to say who it was,\" he said at his Mar-a-Lago residence[4][9].",

The S&P 500 gained approximately 17.4% for 2025, while the Nasdaq Composite surged 21%[1][2][3]. However, these gains masked what traders called one of the most volatile years in recent memory, punctuated by President Donald Trump's tariff announcements in April that sent global markets into a tailspin[4][5].\n\nThe defining moment came April 2-3, when Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement triggered the worst two-day decline for the S&P 500 since the pandemic began, with the index teetering on the brink of a bear market[4][5]. Markets rebounded dramatically on April 9 when Trump paused many tariffs for 90 days, with the S&P 500 soaring 9.5% in a single session\u2014its largest one-day gain since October 2008[4].",

Applications that fail to meet this threshold are typically rejected, though authorities grant flexibility depending on supply constraints[1][2].",

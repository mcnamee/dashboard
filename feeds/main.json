      "description": "Russia recorded a federal budget deficit of 5.645 trillion rubles ($72.3 billion) in 2025, the largest since at least 1996, according to data released by the Finance Ministry on Sunday. The shortfall more than doubled from 3.47 trillion rubles the previous year, exposing the mounting fiscal strain of nearly three years of war in Ukraine.[1][2]\n\nThe record gap came despite aggressive spending cuts in December, when expenditures fell 19% from a year earlier as the government moved to keep the deficit within its revised target of 2.6% of GDP. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov confirmed the target was met in an interview with Interfax last week.[3][4]",

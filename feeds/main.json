The findings, released in December 2025, pose what researchers call a \"serious challenge\" to the standard model that has guided our understanding of the cosmos for nearly a century[1][3][4].\n\nSubir Sarkar, Emeritus Professor at the University of Oxford, and colleagues examined what they term the \"cosmic dipole anomaly\"\u2014a discrepancy between variations in the cosmic microwave background radiation and the distribution of distant matter[1][2][3][6][4]. According to The Conversation, the universe fails what's known as the Ellis-Baldwin test, showing that variations in matter don't align with those in the relic radiation from the Big Bang[3][7].",

The vessel was intercepted despite not being listed among U.S.-sanctioned vessels[4]. A third tanker, the Bella 1, was being actively pursued by the Coast Guard as of Sunday[5][6].",

      "description": "Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has affirmed that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is \"most likely natural,\" tempering months of speculation about extraterrestrial technology while simultaneously proposing an unconventional use for such cosmic visitors: delivering humanity's messages to the stars[1][2][3].\n\nIn a paper published December 21 on Medium, Loeb outlined how interstellar objects could serve as faster messengers than humanity's current efforts, dramatically reducing the time needed to send artifacts beyond our solar system[1][4]. The timing of Loeb's proposal came just two days after 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, passing within 168 million miles of our planet[5][6].\n\n\"Riding 3I/ATLAS offers the benefit of reaching interstellar space by the year ~10,000 CE instead of the year ~30,000 CE,\" Loeb wrote, comparing the comet's trajectory to NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft[1][4]. The Voyager probe, launched in 1977, travels at 17 kilometers per second and will require another 28,000 years to reach the assumed edge of the solar system, according to Loeb's calculations[1]. In contrast, 3I/ATLAS moves at 60 kilometers per second, cutting the journey time by more than two-thirds[1].",

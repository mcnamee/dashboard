According to Investing.com, the tariffs would increase to 25 percent on June 1 and remain in place until \"a deal is reached for the United States to purchase Greenland\".[1][2][3]",

The criticism comes one day after the US Embassy in South Africa publicly lambasted the country for allowing Iran to participate in the drills alongside Chinese and Russian vessels.[1][2]\n\nThe week-long exercises, which ran from January 9 to 16, brought together naval forces from Iran, China, Russia, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates, along with observers from Brazil, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Egypt. The drills are described by South African officials as part of the BRICS Plus framework aimed at enhancing maritime security.[3][4][5]",

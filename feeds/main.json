      "description": "Seven months after the discovery of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, NASA has confirmed that the comet was captured in observational datasets dating back to May 2025\u2014almost two months before astronomers identified it as a visitor from another star system. The revelation is prompting renewed scrutiny of planetary defense detection capabilities.\n\nAccording to peer-reviewed research and NASA statements, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) recorded the comet nearly continuously from May 7 to June 2, 2025\u201455 days before its official discovery on July 1, 2025. The object was too faint to be detected in individual 200-second TESS exposures, and only became visible when researchers retroactively stacked thousands of images after learning where to look.[1][2][3][4]\n\n\"The mission's wide field of view previously happened to observe 3I/ATLAS in May 2025, almost two months before it was discovered,\" NASA stated in a January 27 blog post announcing new TESS observations of the comet. \"Astronomers looking back at the TESS data were able to identify the faint comet by stacking multiple observations to track its movement.\"[5]",

      "description": "Bob Iger has informed associates he intends to step down as chief executive of the Walt Disney Company before his contract expires at the end of 2026, according to The Wall Street Journal. The entertainment giant's board of directors is scheduled to convene next week at Disney's headquarters in Burbank, California, where they are expected to select Iger's successor.[1][2][3]\n\nThe announcement signals a turning point in a succession process that has shadowed one of Hollywood's most influential executives. For Disney, the stakes are especially high after the company's 2020 leadership transition ended with the dismissal of Bob Chapek and the forced return of the 74-year-old Iger.[4][5]",

Musk's satellite internet service Starlink drives the company's finances, accounting for 50 to 80 percent of total revenue, according to people familiar with the company's results.[4][3]",

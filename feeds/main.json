Funded under NASA's Astrophysics Pioneers program, which emphasizes small, ambitious missions with tight budget constraints, Pandora aims to complement observations from the James Webb Space Telescope by addressing a persistent challenge in exoplanet research: separating the light signatures of planets from those of their host stars[1][3].",

      "description": "As the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS completed its closest pass to Earth last week, Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb revealed new findings that characterize the visitor through what it isn't saying. Radio observations detected no artificial signals from the object, which approached within 167 million miles of our planet on December 19[1][2].\n\nLoeb detailed radio data from the Allen Telescope Array and the Green Bank Telescope in recent blog posts, describing what he calls \"an almost unsettling degree of quietude\"[3]. Observations conducted on December 18 by the Breakthrough Listen program using the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope detected no candidate signals down to the 100-milliwatt level\u2014roughly the power output of a cell phone[4][5][6].",

      "description": "Researchers at the University of Iowa have developed a theoretical method to \"purify\" photons that could address critical obstacles in building faster quantum computers and more secure communication networks, according to a study published in the journal Optica Quantum[1][2][3].\n\nThe breakthrough centers on transforming a persistent problem in quantum photonics into a solution. Graduate student Matthew Nelson discovered that unwanted photons produced during laser operations share nearly identical wavelength and waveform characteristics with the interfering laser light itself[1][3]. This similarity allows the two noise sources to be tuned to cancel each other out through destructive interference, yielding a significantly cleaner stream of single photons\u2014the fundamental units needed for photonic quantum systems[4][1][2].",

While flying wing aircraft like the U.S. B-2 Spirit excel at evading detection, their tailless design makes them vulnerable to dangerous vibrations at high speeds, forcing designers to limit them to subsonic flight.",

      "description": "The anti-government protests convulsing Iran since late December are rooted not only in economic collapse and political repression but in a deeper, environmental catastrophe that has reached an inflection point. Dwindling water supplies, poisonous air, and crumbling infrastructure have compelled Iranians to take to the streets in the deadliest uprising the country has seen in decades.\n\nA new analysis published this week by Nima Shokri of the United Nations University reveals a pattern: protests are more likely to erupt in areas suffering from groundwater depletion, land subsidence, and water rationing. Provinces such as Tehran, Khuzestan in the southwest, and Isfahan in central Iran, all regions with high levels of protest, are grappling with acute water shortages and disputes over access.[1][2][3]",

It is part of a research effort in which Stanford University and Arc Institute scientists used genome language models\u2014AI systems trained on DNA rather than text\u2014to generate complete phage genomes and test them against Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the lab. The researchers reported 16 viable, AI-designed phages, with several showing **higher fitness and faster bacterial killing** than the natural phage template, \u03a6X174, in competition and lysis experiments.[1][2][3][4]",

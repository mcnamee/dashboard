The statement came as Beijing deployed what Taiwan's defense ministry described as 14 naval ships, 89 military aircraft, and an amphibious strike force in exercises designed to simulate a blockade[3].\n\n\"The Chinese Communist Party's escalation of military pressure is not the conduct expected from a responsible power,\" Lai said in a social media statement Tuesday morning, adding that Taiwan's military and national security team would \"do their utmost to ensure the safety of the nation\"[4]. Presidential Office spokesperson Karen Kuo condemned China's actions as \"military intimidation\" that \"undermine the stability and security of the Taiwan Strait and Indo-Pacific region\"[5][6][7].",

The period spanning 2023 to 2025 marks a critical milestone in the acceleration of climate change, with 2025 ranking as one of the three hottest years on record[1][2][3][4].\n\nThe findings from researchers at World Weather Attribution, published December 29, underscore how human-induced climate change made 2025 one of the warmest years ever documented, despite the presence of La Ni\u00f1a conditions that typically cool global temperatures[1][5]. The European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service reported that November 2025 saw global temperatures reach 1.54\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels[3][4].\n\n\"If we do not cease the burning of fossil fuels very quickly, it will become exceedingly difficult to achieve that warming goal,\" said Friederike Otto, co-lead of World Weather Attribution and a climate scientist at Imperial College London[1]. \"The scientific evidence is becoming increasingly unequivocal.\"",

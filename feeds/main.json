      "description": "An interstellar comet that swept past Earth last week is exhibiting behavior that challenges conventional understanding of cometary physics, according to new analyses published by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. The object, designated 3I/ATLAS, shed unexpectedly large particles as it traveled through the solar system and displayed a rare wobbling jet structure never before observed in a visitor from another star.\n\nIn an essay published December 25, Loeb examined the comet's unusual \"anti-tail\"\u2014a jet of material pointing toward the Sun rather than away from it\u2014and determined that it contains particles significantly larger than typical comet dust[1]. While standard comet tails are dominated by particles around 0.5 microns in radius, the material in 3I/ATLAS's anti-tail measures between 1 and 100 microns, according to Loeb's analysis[2][1]. This size range is necessary to explain how the particles could travel the observed distance of up to 500,000 kilometers toward the Sun without being immediately stopped by solar radiation pressure[3][4][5].\n\n\"The observed length of the anti-tail produced by 3I/ATLAS can only be maintained by particles that are considerably larger than typical dust particles,\" Loeb wrote, adding that such features are difficult to explain using standard comet physics[2][1].",

The framework was formally delivered to Russian President Vladimir Putin's government on December 24, though the Kremlin has given no indication it will accept the terms[2][3].",

He criticized \"the falsehoods that fill the pompous speeches of those who send them to their deaths\" regarding young soldiers forced into combat[2][3].",

Every second, a trillion neutrinos pass through the human body without interaction, earning them the nickname \"ghost particles\"[1][3][4].\n\n\"For the first time, we have a concrete estimate of how many of these particles reach Earth, where in the galaxy they come from, and how their energy is distributed,\" said lead author Pablo Mart\u00ednez-Mirav\u00e9, a postdoc at the University of Copenhagen's Niels Bohr Institute[1][3][4].",

The breakthrough, published this week in the journal Advanced Materials, replaces the scarce and expensive metal with nanoparticles made from electrically conductive plastic[1][2][3][4].\n\nThe innovation addresses a critical challenge in the transition to renewable energy. While hydrogen produces only water as a byproduct when used, its production has long relied on platinum as a co-catalyst\u2014a metal with limited global reserves concentrated primarily in South Africa and Russia, according to the research team[2][3]. The extraction process poses environmental and health risks, and platinum's scarcity has hampered efforts to scale green hydrogen production[2][3].",

The blade exceeds 110 meters (361 feet) in length and uses a chemical degradation solution that operates at ambient temperature and pressure, addressing one of the wind energy sector's most persistent environmental challenges[1][2][4].\n\nThe announcement comes just days after Europe's wind industry implemented a self-imposed ban on landfilling turbine blades, effective January 1, 2026[5][6][7]. According to Ming Yang, the MySE23X features recyclable carbon fiber pultruded panels that provide lightweight support while enabling complete recovery of carbon fiber materials[2][3][4]. Unlike previous recycling methods requiring extreme heat or high pressure, this technology dissolves the adhesive binding blade components at ambient conditions, allowing carbon fiber to be extracted, cleaned and repurposed for applications including new turbines and automotive parts[1][2].",

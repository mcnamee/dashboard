      "description": "Harvard physicist Avi Loeb has intensified his claim that the interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS may be an alien spacecraft, citing new Hubble Space Telescope images that reveal an unusual dual-jet structure as the object speeds away from Earth.\n\nObservations captured on December 12 and 27 show two distinct jets of material streaming from the object's nucleus, with one pointing toward the Sun and a weaker jet extending in the opposite direction[1][2][3]. As one jet brightens, the other fades in what Loeb describes as a \"clean, repeatable and geometrically consistent swap\"[4].\n\nLoeb, a Harvard astrophysicist who leads the Galileo Project, has ranked 3I/ATLAS a \"four\" on his personal scale of zero to ten, where zero represents a natural comet and ten signifies an active alien threat[5][6]. \"You can't just say, 'I know the answer' and ignore the anomalies. That's not viable,\" Loeb said[5][6].\n\n3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, is only the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019[7][8]. The object passed Earth on December 19 at a safe distance of roughly 170 million miles and is now heading toward Jupiter, where it will make its closest approach on March 16, 2026[5][9].",

Yemen's Saudi-backed Presidential Leadership Council cancelled its defense pact with the UAE and demanded all Emirati forces leave the country within 24 hours[1][3].\n\n\"The Kingdom expresses its disappointment by the actions taken by the brotherly United Arab Emirates, pressuring the Southern Transitional Council's forces to conduct military operations on the southern border of the Kingdom,\" Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry said in a statement[1][2].

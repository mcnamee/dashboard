      "description": "The 56th World Economic Forum Annual Meeting commenced in Davos on Monday evening, marking the first time in the event's history that founder Klaus Schwab was not at the helm. Interim co-chairs Larry Fink and Andr\u00e9 Hoffmann opened proceedings with welcoming remarks at an opening concert, signaling a new chapter for the influential gathering of global elites.\n\nSchwab, 87, stepped down as chairman in April 2025, effective immediately, after the WEF board moved to investigate whistleblower allegations of financial and ethical misconduct involving him and his wife, Hilde. The Wall Street Journal first reported that an anonymous letter to the board accused the Schwabs of improperly intermingling personal finances with forum resources, including allegations that Schwab directed subordinates to withdraw thousands of dollars from ATMs on his behalf and used WEF funds for private hotel massages.[1][2][3]",

      "description": "Scientists have demonstrated that earthquake monitors can track falling space debris through sonic booms, offering a new method to pinpoint where dangerous fragments land as the skies become increasingly crowded with satellites.\n\nResearchers reported Thursday that seismic readings from sonic booms generated when a discarded Chinese crew capsule module reentered over Southern California in 2024 allowed them to place the object's path nearly 20 miles farther south than radar had predicted from orbit, according to findings published in the journal Science.[1][2][3]\n\n\"The problem at the moment is we can track stuff very well in space,\" said Benjamin Fernando of Johns Hopkins University, the lead researcher. \"But once it gets to the point that it's actually breaking up in the atmosphere, it becomes very difficult to track.\"[2][4]",

But the deal's specifics remain unclear, and Denmark has firmly stated its sovereignty is not up for negotiation.",

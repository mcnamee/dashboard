While most comets vent gas and dust in irregular, flickering plumes as they are heated by the sun, 3I/ATLAS has maintained this geometric precision for weeks, with each jet displaying comparable brightness and curvature[1][3].",

The warning came as human rights groups reported at least 39 to 45 protesters have been killed since demonstrations erupted in late December, including eight minors[4][5][6][7].\n\nThe protests, which began December 28 at Tehran's Grand Bazaar over economic grievances, have spread to all 31 provinces[4][8]. Violence intensified on Thursday evening after exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi called for coordinated demonstrations at 8 p.m. local time[9][5]. Witnesses reported crowds chanting \"Death to the dictator\" and \"Pahlavi will return\" across Tehran and other major cities[9][5].",

      "description": "The United Nations said Thursday the United States has a legal obligation to continue funding U.N. agencies, one day after President Donald Trump signed an order withdrawing from 66 international organizations, including 31 affiliated with the world body[1][2][3].\n\nSecretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed regret over the decision and stressed that assessed contributions to the U.N. regular budget and peacekeeping operations \"are a legal obligation under the UN Charter for all Member States, including the United States,\" according to spokesman Stephane Dujarric[1][4][5]. The statement came as U.N. officials said they learned of the withdrawal through news reports and White House social media posts Wednesday, with no formal notification from the Trump administration[1][2].\n\nThe executive order, which followed a yearlong review, targets organizations the White House says promote \"radical climate policies, global governance, and ideological programs that conflict with U.S. sovereignty and economic strength\"[6][7][8]. Among the 31 U.N. entities are the U.N. Population Fund, which provides reproductive health services in more than 150 countries, and UN Women, which promotes gender equality[1][2][9]. The order also directs withdrawal from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, the 1992 treaty that underpins the Paris climate agreement[6][1][2].\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio defended the move in a statement, saying the Trump administration determined the organizations were \"redundant, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run\" or advancing agendas inconsistent with U.S. interests[10][11][12]. The White House said the withdrawals would end American taxpayer funding for entities \"that advance globalist agendas over U.S. priorities\"[6][13][9].",

The research marks the first detection of nanoplastics as small as 200 nanometers in complex environmental samples[4][1][2].",

The protests, which began in Tehran's Grand Bazaar on December 28 over economic grievances, have now spread to all 31 of Iran's provinces and evolved into broader calls for regime change[2][1].\n\nInternet monitoring group NetBlocks reported a nationwide internet blackout on Thursday as authorities intensified efforts to suppress the demonstrations[3][4]. \"The evidence shows that the scope of crackdown is becoming more violent and more extensive every day,\" said Iran Human Rights director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, adding that hundreds more have been wounded and over 2,000 arrested[1].",

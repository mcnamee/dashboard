      "description": "New images of the interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS from the Hubble Space Telescope have revealed an unusual configuration of jets emanating from its nucleus, with three distinct plumes arranged in near-perfect 120-degree symmetry. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who has been analyzing the data, says the geometric precision of the formation is difficult to reconcile with standard cometary outgassing and raises questions about the object's origins.\n\nImages captured by Hubble on January 7 and January 14, 2026, and processed by researcher Toni Scarmato using the Larson-Sekanina Rotational Gradient filter, show three collimated mini-jets extending tens of thousands of kilometers into space, each separated by exactly 120 degrees in projection. A fourth \"anti-tail\" jet points directly toward the sun, stretching up to 400,000 kilometers \u2014 a length that Loeb argues has never been reported before for solar system comets.[1][2][3][4]",

      "description": "Approximately 1,500 Islamic State members escaped from Shaddadi prison in northeastern Syria on Monday, according to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, as a ceasefire deal between Kurdish fighters and the Damascus government appeared to collapse just one day after it was announced.\n\nSDF spokesperson Farhad Shami told the Kurdish website Rudaw that the mass prison break occurred after \"Damascus factions\" launched repeated attacks on the facility, which held thousands of ISIS detainees. The Syrian army denied attacking the prison and instead accused the SDF of deliberately releasing the militants. By Monday evening, Syrian officials said they had regained control of both the city and the prison, and imposed a curfew while troops searched for escapees.[1][2][3][4]",

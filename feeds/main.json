The platform claims to deliver five times more AI training performance than its Blackwell predecessor while reducing inference token costs by tenfold[6][7]. Huang also introduced Alpamayo, an open-source autonomous driving AI model trained on 1,700 hours of driving data, which Mercedes-Benz will integrate into its upcoming CLA model[3][8][9].\n\nAMD, not to be outdone, showcased its massive Helios rack-scale platform at CEO Lisa Su's keynote. The system weighs 7,000 pounds\u2014equivalent to two compact cars\u2014and houses 72 MI455X GPUs delivering up to 2.9 exaflops of AI inference performance[10][11][12]. The company also unveiled its Ryzen AI 400 series processors for laptops, featuring up to 60 TOPS of AI computing power and set to launch in the first quarter of 2026[10][13][14].\n\nIntel countered with its Core Ultra Series 3 processors, branded Panther Lake, marking the first AI PC platform built on the company's 18A process technology and manufactured in the United States[15][16][17]. The chips will power over 200 PC designs from global partners, with consumer laptops available starting January 27[15][16]. Intel claims up to 180 platform TOPS and promises more than 50 percent faster CPU performance compared to previous generations[16][18].",

The anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now first reported the tender. Yoni Mizrahi, who runs the group's settlement watch division, said initial work could begin within the month[1][2][4].\n\nThe move follows Israel's final approval of the E1 project in August 2025, when the Higher Planning Council validated plans after rejecting all objections[5][6]. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right politician who oversees settlement policy, has championed the project. \"The Palestinian state is being erased from the table not with slogans but with actions,\" he said when Israel gave final approval to the plan in August[3][7]. \"Every settlement, every neighborhood, every housing unit is another nail in the coffin of this dangerous idea.\"",

      "description": "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller asserted Monday that Greenland should become part of the United States, questioning Denmark's sovereignty over the Arctic territory and refusing to rule out the use of military force to acquire it[1][2]. The statements, made during a CNN interview, triggered sharp rebukes from European leaders who warned that such action would threaten the NATO alliance and upside decades of post-World War II security cooperation[3][4].\n\n\"Nobody is going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,\" Miller said when pressed repeatedly about whether Washington would rule out military intervention[5][6]. He challenged Denmark's territorial claims, asking \"by what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland?\"[7][2]\n\nThe comments came days after a provocative social media post by Miller's wife, Katie Miller, who shared an image Saturday of Greenland covered in the American flag with the caption \"SOON\"[8][9]. The post followed closely on the heels of a U.S. military operation in Venezuela that captured President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, raising international concerns about the Trump administration's willingness to use force against sovereign nations.",

      "description": "Japanese research teams are making parallel strides in quantum computing, with scientists at Institute of Science Tokyo achieving near-theoretical performance in error correction while RIKEN develops software to merge quantum computers with supercomputers.\n\nA team led by Associate Professor Kenta Kasai at Institute of Science Tokyo has developed quantum error-correction codes that approach the theoretical limit known as the hashing bound, according to research published in npj Quantum Information[1][2][3][4]. The codes achieved a frame error rate as low as 10\u207b\u2074 for systems with hundreds of thousands of qubits, with decoding complexity that scales proportionally to the number of physical qubits\u2014addressing a major barrier to practical quantum computing[1][2].\n\nTraditional quantum error-correction methods hit an accuracy ceiling far below theoretical limits, requiring heavy computation that made large-scale systems impractical[1][2]. Kasai and Master's student Daiki Komoto constructed low-density parity-check codes defined over non-binary finite fields that handle both bit-flip and phase-flip errors simultaneously[3][5]. \"Our quantum error-correcting code has a greater than 1/2 code rate, targeting hundreds of thousands of logical qubits,\" Kasai said[3][4]. The breakthrough could enable quantum computers to scale to millions of logical qubits, potentially advancing drug discovery, cryptography and climate prediction[1][6].",

However, at least one in five systems degrade at least 1.5 times faster than this typical rate, and roughly one in 12 degrade twice as fast.\"\n\nFor operators of solar farms where hundreds of thousands of panels are installed, the findings represent a hidden financial risk that challenges the economic models underpinning the industry's growth[1][2][3].",

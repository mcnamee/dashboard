The date change was first reported by Politico on Friday and has been updated on the G7's official website[6][3][5].\n\nJune 14 marks Flag Day in the United States, Trump's milestone birthday, and the date he announced in October for a \"big UFC fight\" on the White House grounds as part of the nation's 250th anniversary celebrations[7][8][9]. UFC CEO Dana White confirmed to CBS News this week that preparations are complete, with approximately 5,000 spectators expected on the South Lawn and up to 85,000 more at a public viewing area on the nearby Ellipse[10][11].",

NetBlocks, an internet monitoring organization, confirmed connectivity had plummeted to approximately 1% of ordinary levels by Friday, effectively isolating Iran's 71.9 million internet users from the outside world[1][7][8]. \"Iran is now in the midst of a nationwide internet blackout,\" NetBlocks stated on social media platform X, adding that the shutdown \"hinders the public's right to communicate at a critical moment\"[8].\n\nThe demonstrations, which began in late December with merchants in Tehran protesting the rial's freefall to over 1.4 million per dollar, have since spread to all 31 provinces and evolved into broader calls for regime change[1][3][9]. The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported that 34 protesters and eight security personnel have died, with injuries largely caused by live ammunition, pellet shots, and plastic bullets[2][3][10].",

Speaking on the All-In Podcast, Lutnick said India was given \"three Fridays\" to seal the deal but proved \"uncomfortable\" arranging the call[1][2][3][4]. \"I said \u2014 You need to have Modi; it's all arranged. Modi must call the president. Yet, they were hesitant to do it,\" Lutnick said. \"Consequently, Modi did not make the call\"[1].\n\nIndia swiftly rejected the characterization. Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters Friday that the two leaders spoke eight times during 2025 and that both nations have been \"close to a deal\" on multiple occasions[1][5][6]. \"The characterization of these discussions in the reported remarks is not accurate,\" Jaiswal said, adding that India remains \"interested in a mutually beneficial trade deal\"[7][2][6].\n\nThe White House has not responded to Lutnick's comments[3][8].",

      "description": "Researchers in Switzerland and South Korea have announced separate breakthroughs this week that could accelerate the commercialization of all-solid-state lithium batteries, addressing two of the technology's most persistent challenges: dendrite formation and high manufacturing costs.\n\nOn January 7, the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland reported a new production process that combines gentle sintering with a thin protective coating to stabilize battery performance[1][2][3][4]. The approach achieved 75 percent capacity retention after 1,500 charge cycles, among the best results reported to date for solid-state systems[1][3]. Meanwhile, researchers at South Korea's KAIST announced a structural design breakthrough that boosted lithium ion mobility by two to four times using inexpensive materials, published in Nature Communications[5][6][7][8].",

The visit represents the first US diplomatic presence in Venezuela since Maduro's capture in a military operation on January 3, 2026[7][8].",

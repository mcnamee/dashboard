Denmark's ambassador to the United States, Jesper Moeller Soerensen, responded swiftly, declaring his country expects \"full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark\"[3][4].",

The study, led by Jessica Zamborain-Mason of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, calculated that recovery could generate between 20,000 and 162 million additional sustainable fish servings per country annually\u2014enough to meet recommended seafood intake for up to 1.4 million additional people per year[6][1][5].\n\n\"Our study quantifies how much is being lost by having overfished reef fish communities in terms of food provisioning and, in turn, how much could be gained from rebuilding reef fish stocks and managing them at sustainable levels,\" Zamborain-Mason said[6][1][4].",

      "description": "The world's most sensitive radio telescope has found no evidence of artificial signals from 3I/ATLAS, the largest interstellar object ever detected, according to results published this week by the Breakthrough Listen program[1][2][3]. Yet the mysterious visitor continues to captivate astronomers with unusual features that challenge conventional understanding of comets.\n\nOn December 18, one day before the object's closest approach to Earth, the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia scanned 3I/ATLAS across radio frequencies from 1 to 12 gigahertz[3][4][5]. The search, conducted by a team led by astronomer Ben Jacobson-Bell of the University of California, Berkeley, initially flagged 471,198 potential signals[4][6]. After filtering out interference, nine candidates remained\u2014all of which were traced to human-made radio noise on Earth[2][4].\n\n\"No artificial radio emission localized to 3I/ATLAS was detected,\" the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute confirmed[1][2][7]. The telescope was sensitive enough to detect transmitters as weak as 100 milliwatts, roughly the power of a mobile phone[8][3].",

Rodriguez, 56, stepped into the role Saturday afternoon, hours after the U.S. military operation[2][3].\n\nUnder Venezuela's constitution, the executive vice president assumes presidential duties when the president becomes temporarily or permanently unavailable to serve[2][3][4]. Articles 233 and 234 outline the succession process, making Rodriguez's assumption of power the legally prescribed course of action[2][3].",

The paralysis threatens to further cripple the economy of a country sitting atop the world's largest proven oil reserves.\n\nFollowing weeks of mounting pressure, including vessel seizures and sanctions, oil shipments from Venezuela have effectively ceased, with only tankers chartered by Chevron continuing operations under special U.S. authorization. More than 11 million barrels of crude remain stranded on vessels in Venezuelan waters, while the country's storage facilities have filled to capacity, forcing state oil company PDVSA to shut in wells across its main production region[1][2][3].",

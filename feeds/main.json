      "description": "Two weeks of nationwide protests in Iran have left more than 500 people dead as authorities intensified their crackdown under the cover of a near-total internet blackout, according to rights groups monitoring the unrest that has evolved into one of the most serious challenges to the Islamic Republic's theocratic government in years.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported Sunday that at least 538 people have been killed, including 490 protesters and 48 security personnel[1][2][3]. More than 10,600 people have been arrested[1][2][4][3]. The Norway-based Iran Human Rights organization separately documented 192 deaths, warning the actual toll could be significantly higher as the ongoing communications blackout has made verification increasingly difficult[5][6].\n\nThe protests erupted on December 28 following the collapse of Iran's currency, the rial, which now trades at over 1.4 million to one U.S. dollar as the country's economy buckles under international sanctions[4][3][7]. What began as demonstrations over economic hardship has transformed into direct challenges to Iran's theocratic regime, with protesters chanting \"Death to Khamenei\" in reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei[8][9].",

Some reports suggest the actual toll may be far higher, with one Tehran doctor telling TIME that at least 217 deaths had been recorded across six hospitals in the capital alone[5].\n\nMedical staff at hospitals in Tehran, Rasht, and Shiraz described facilities overwhelmed by the wounded and dead. A hospital worker in Tehran told the BBC that casualties were so numerous that \"there wasn't enough space in the morgue; the bodies were placed on top of one another\"[6][7]. Another medic reported security forces firing \"direct shots to the heads of the young people, to their hearts as well\"[6][7].

      "description": "Researchers at the University of New South Wales have developed a motor that operates using a droplet of liquid metal instead of traditional rigid components\u2014a breakthrough that could reshape the future of soft robotics, flexible electronics, and medical devices.\n\nThe tiny device, called a liquid metal droplet rotary paddle motor, generates motion through swirling flows inside a liquid metal droplet embedded in a salt solution and exposed to an electric field. A small copper paddle placed within the swirling metal is carried along by these internal flows, creating rotation at speeds of up to 320 revolutions per minute.[1][2][3]\n\n\"This is a completely new way to create motion,\" said Dr Priyank Kumar, a UNSW Senior Lecturer who supervised the project and served as the corresponding author on a paper published in npj Flexible Electronics. \"We're harnessing the flow of liquid metal itself to produce rotation, without any traditional moving parts. It's simple, compact, and inherently flexible\".[2][1]",

The figure represents a 17% decline from the 9.54 million births recorded in 2024, dashing hopes that a modest uptick last year signaled a reversal of the country's deepening demographic crisis.[1][2][3]\n\nThe birth rate fell to 5.63 births per 1,000 people, marking the lowest level in more than seven decades of record-keeping. Meanwhile, deaths climbed to 11.31 million, the highest mortality rate since 1968, resulting in a net population decline of 3.39 million. China's total population now stands at 1.405 billion, shrinking for the fourth consecutive year.[4][5][6]",

      "description": "At least 21 people were killed and up to 100 injured when two high-speed trains collided in southern Spain on Sunday evening after one derailed and crossed into the path of an oncoming service, prompting authorities to suspend all rail traffic between Madrid and the Andalusia region.\n\nThe crash occurred at approximately 6:40 p.m. local time near the town of Adamuz in C\u00f3rdoba province when an Iryo train traveling from M\u00e1laga to Madrid derailed and struck a Renfe train heading from Madrid to Huelva, according to Spanish rail network operator Adif. Both trains were carrying hundreds of passengers\u2014roughly 300 on the Iryo service and around 100 to 200 on the Renfe train.[1][2][3][4]\n\nSpain's Transport Minister \u00d3scar Puente confirmed the death toll after midnight, stating that all survivors had been rescued from the wreckage. Among those killed was the driver of the Renfe train, according to state broadcaster Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola. Officials said 25 of the injured sustained serious wounds, with 73 passengers transported to six different hospitals.[2][5][6][4][7]",

Anthropic is targeting a total raise of $25 billion or more, which would close to double its $183 billion valuation from September's Series F round.[3][4][5][1]",

      "description": "Two new studies reveal that the systems powering AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini share unexpected parallels with the human brain\u2014not just in how they build meaning from words, but also in how they absorb social biases.\n\nResearch published in Nature Communications found that the human brain processes spoken language through a stepwise sequence that closely mirrors the layered architecture of large language models (LLMs). A separate study from the University of Vermont, posted to the arXiv preprint server, shows that widely used AI models exhibit \"us vs. them\" social biases similar to patterns documented in human psychology.[1][2][3][4]",

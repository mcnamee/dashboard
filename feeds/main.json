One person died in Santa Barbara County after being swept into a creek, while the Santa Barbara Airport closed operations due to floodwaters covering runways[1][2]. San Francisco recorded its highest tide since 1998, with water levels reaching 2.56 feet above normal[3][4].\n\nIn Queensland, Australia, catastrophic flooding killed at least one person and left more than 19,000 livestock dead or missing as of Monday[5][6]. The Australian government announced a $38 million disaster recovery package for affected communities[5][7]. Meanwhile, flash floods in Indonesia's North Sulawesi province killed at least 14 people on Monday, with six others still missing[8]",

Chipmakers Nvidia, AMD, and Intel unveiled next-generation processors designed to power this shift, while robot manufacturers demonstrated machines that can finally tackle one of home automation's last frontiers: climbing stairs.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang kicked off the show by announcing the Vera Rubin platform, a next-generation AI superchip architecture now in full production that the company claims offers more than triple the speed of its current Blackwell chips[1][2]. The platform, named after astronomer Vera Rubin, combines six chips into what Nvidia calls \"one AI supercomputer,\" with products expected to roll out from partners in the second half of 2026[2][3].\n\n\"The moment for physical AI has arrived\u2014when machines start to comprehend, reason, and operate in the real world,\" Huang said during his keynote[4]. He also unveiled Alpamayo, an AI model for autonomous vehicles that uses vision-language-action models to handle unfamiliar driving scenarios[2][5]. Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola K\u00e4llenius reported testing the Nvidia-powered system on public roads, driving for more than an hour through heavy traffic, with the vehicles expected to launch in the first quarter of 2026[2].\n\nAMD CEO Lisa Su showcased the company's Ryzen AI 400 series processors for PCs, claiming 1.3 times faster multitasking and 1.7 times quicker content creation compared to competitors[6][7]. The company also detailed its forthcoming MI500 series data center GPUs, asserting they will deliver up to a 1,000-fold enhancement in AI performance compared to the MI300X GPUs[7]. Intel announced its Panther Lake processors, branded as Core Ultra Series 3, featuring up to 180 platform TOPS (trillions of operations per second) for AI acceleration and claiming more than 50% faster CPU and graphics performance versus the previous generation[8]",

The platform claims to deliver five times more AI training performance than its Blackwell predecessor while reducing inference token costs by tenfold[6][7]. Huang also introduced Alpamayo, an open-source autonomous driving AI model trained on 1,700 hours of driving data, which Mercedes-Benz will integrate into its upcoming CLA model[3][8][9].\n\nAMD, not to be outdone, showcased its massive Helios rack-scale platform at CEO Lisa Su's keynote. The system weighs 7,000 pounds\u2014equivalent to two compact cars\u2014and houses 72 MI455X GPUs delivering up to 2.9 exaflops of AI inference performance[10][11][12]. The company also unveiled its Ryzen AI 400 series processors for laptops, featuring up to 60 TOPS of AI computing power and set to launch in the first quarter of 2026[10][13][14].\n\nIntel countered with its Core Ultra Series 3 processors, branded Panther Lake, marking the first AI PC platform built on the company's 18A process technology and manufactured in the United States[15][16][17]. The chips will power over 200 PC designs from global partners, with consumer laptops available starting January 27[15][16]. Intel claims up to 180 platform TOPS and promises more than 50 percent faster CPU performance compared to previous generations[16][18].",

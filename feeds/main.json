Harvard physicist Avi Loeb continues to argue that unusual features of the comet warrant consideration of extraterrestrial origins, while NASA and mainstream astronomers maintain overwhelming evidence points to natural cometary behavior.\n\nOn December 18, the Breakthrough Listen program conducted a technosignature search of 3I/ATLAS using the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope, less than 24 hours before the object's closest approach to Earth[1][2]. The search, which scanned radio frequencies from 1 to 12 gigahertz, found no artificial signals down to a sensitivity of 100 milliwatts[2]. \"We report a nondetection of candidate signals down to the 100 mW level,\" researchers wrote in findings published this week[2].\n\nThe comet passed within approximately 168 million miles of Earth on December 19, posing no threat to our planet[3][4]. Discovered on July 1 by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile, 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object ever detected passing through our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019[3][5].",

The proposal includes NATO-style security guarantees modeled on Article 5, provisions for demilitarized zones in eastern Ukraine, and arrangements for disputed territories[12][13][14][15]. However, Trump emphasized his final authority over any agreement, telling Politico on Friday: \"He doesn't have anything until I approve it. So we'll see what he's got\"[16][4][5].",

The meeting, set for Sunday afternoon, is part of ongoing efforts to advance a 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the nearly four-year conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe White House confirmed that Trump and Zelensky would meet at 3 p.m. local time in Palm Beach[5][6]. Zelensky arrived in the United States after stopping in Halifax, where Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney pledged an additional $2.5 billion in economic assistance for Ukraine[7][8][9]. The aid package includes loan guarantees to the World Bank and financing that will enable the International Monetary Fund to lend an additional $8.4 billion to Ukraine[10].",

Instead of simply evading enemy radar, future stealth aircraft could absorb those same detection beams to power onboard systems or communications equipment, according to the research team led by Yajie Mu and colleagues[1][2][3].",

      "description": "The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which passed Earth last week at a distance of 167 million miles, continues to generate controversy as scientists and lawmakers press NASA for greater transparency about the third confirmed visitor from beyond our solar system[1][2]. The rare cosmic object has exhibited unpredictable trajectory changes and unusual features that challenge standard comet models, intensifying calls for the release of raw observational data[3][4].\n\nIn late December, astronomers observed that 3I/ATLAS had deviated from its predicted path due to non-gravitational acceleration\u2014forces not accounted for by gravity alone[3][5]. According to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, the comet experienced a \"radial acceleration away from the Sun of 1.1x10^{-6} au per day squared,\" which would require the object to have shed approximately 13 percent of its total mass during its October perihelion passage[5][6]. However, such a massive gas cloud has not been detected, leaving the acceleration mechanism unexplained[7].",

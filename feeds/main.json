      "description": "For the first time in more than half a century, coal-fired power generation declined simultaneously in China and India last year, according to new analysis, marking what researchers call a \"historic moment\" in the global energy transition.\n\nThe concurrent reduction in coal-generated electricity in the world's two largest coal-consuming nations had not occurred since 1973, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), a Helsinki-based think tank. The analysis, commissioned by the UK climate news platform Carbon Brief, found that coal power generation in India fell by 3% in 2025, while China saw a 1.6% decline.[1][2][3]",

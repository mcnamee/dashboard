A comprehensive international study published January 27 in Nature Plants warns that fast-growing tree species are increasingly dominating forest ecosystems worldwide, displacing slower-growing native trees and reducing both biodiversity and long-term carbon storage capacity.[1][2][3]\n\nThe research team analyzed more than 31,000 tree species globally and found that forests are becoming homogenized as fast-growing varieties such as acacia, eucalyptus, poplar, and pine outcompete specialized native species. Nearly 41 percent of naturalized tree species\u2014those that have established wild populations outside their native ranges\u2014possess traits like rapid growth and small leaves that make them well-suited to disturbed environments but unable to fulfill the ecological roles of the species they replace.[2][4][1]",

On June 8 and 9, the two planets will be positioned within roughly 1.6 degrees of each other, about the width of a thumb held at arm's length, according to the nonprofit Planetary Society. Musk's 55th birthday on June 28 was also a factor in the timing decision, sources said.[2][3][6][5][7][8][1]",

When asked Tuesday whether the dollar had declined too much, Trump told reporters in Iowa, \"No, I think it's great,\" adding that it should \"just seek its own level.\" Traders interpreted the remarks as a green light to sell the U.S. currency aggressively.[1][2][3]",

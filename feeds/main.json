French President Emmanuel Macron announced that many European states and allies will make concrete commitments to protect Ukraine at a meeting in Paris on January 6[5][5].\n\n\"We focused on how to move the discussions forward in a practical way on behalf of @POTUS' peace process, including strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart,\" Witkoff wrote on social media[2][4].",

      "description": "Gold and silver are poised to end 2025 with their most impressive annual gains in more than four decades, despite sharp late-December selloffs that underscored the extraordinary volatility in precious metals markets.\n\nGold climbed approximately 66% this year, while silver surged over 150%, according to multiple market sources[1][2][3][4]. Both metals are heading for their strongest yearly performance since 1979, when the Iranian Revolution and runaway inflation drove gold up 126%[1][5][6][7].\n\nThe year-end rally turned turbulent in late December when CME Group raised margin requirements on precious metals futures twice within a week[8][9][10]. The exchange cited \"market volatility to ensure adequate collateral coverage\" as silver broke above $80 per ounce for the first time and gold approached $4,550[8][11]. Silver margins jumped approximately 30%, while gold requirements rose roughly 9%, forcing traders to post additional cash during one of the year's thinnest trading periods[12][10].\n\nSilver plunged nearly 9% on Monday, December 29, to just above $73 per ounce after briefly exceeding $84 over the weekend[13]. Gold dropped more than 4% to around $4,355[13]. Both metals staged recoveries on Tuesday before falling again Wednesday, with silver declining more than 8% and gold slipping approximately 0.75%[13][14].",

In his annual New Year's Eve address, Xi said Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait share \"a bond of blood and kinship,\" adding that \"the reunification of our motherland, a trend of the times, is unstoppable\"[1][2][3].\n\nThe remarks came one day after China's People's Liberation Army announced it had \"successfully completed\" Justice Mission 2025, a two-day military exercise that encircled Taiwan with warships, fighter jets, and missile forces[1][2][4]. Senior Captain Li Xi, spokesperson for the PLA's Eastern Theater Command, said the drills \"fully tested the integrated joint operations capabilities\" of Chinese troops[1][4].",

Among the wounded were three children\u2014ages seven months, eight, and 14\u2014while a 42-year-old man remained in serious condition[5][2][6]. Firefighters rescued eight people from burning buildings as flames engulfed residential structures[4][7].\n\n\"Another proof that Russia is targeting civilians,\" Serhii Lysak, head of Odesa City Military Administration, wrote on social media[7]. The Ukrainian Energy Ministry reported that emergency repair work was underway, though restoration efforts have been hampered by the extent of damage to critical infrastructure[8][9][10].",

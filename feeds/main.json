The platform, comprising six integrated chips including the Rubin GPU with 336 billion transistors and 288GB of HBM4 memory, is expected to become available through partners in the second half of 2026[1][2][4].\n\n\"The timing of Rubin's launch is perfect, as the demand for AI computing, both for training and inference, is skyrocketing,\" Huang said during his keynote[2]. The announcement comes as Nvidia faces intensifying competition from rivals including Advanced Micro Devices and customers like Alphabet's Google developing their own AI chips[5].",

The stakes are high for Intel, which has struggled with yields and lost market share to AMD in recent years[1]. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the company delivered on its promise to ship products with 18A in 2025[1].\n\nIntel claims the new chips deliver 60% better multithread performance than its previous Lunar Lake Series 2 processors[1][2]. The flagship feature is the new Arc B390 integrated graphics chip, which Intel says offers up to 77% faster gaming performance than Lunar Lake and can match Nvidia's discrete RTX 4050 mobile GPU[1][4]. Pre-orders for laptops with the new processors begin January 6, with systems shipping globally starting January 27[3][5].",

The research challenges assumptions that galaxy evolution proceeded uniformly in the early universe.\n\n\"What is striking is not just that we can detect hidden activity, but that we see such diversity among galaxies with similar masses at the same epoch,\" said Gillian Wilson, vice chancellor for research at UC Merced and professor of physics, who mentored the study[1]. \"That tells us that the shutdown of star formation in the most massive galaxies was neither uniform nor simple.\"",

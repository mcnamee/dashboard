      "description": "A diplomatic rift has emerged between the United States and India over the reasons behind stalled trade negotiations, with Washington and New Delhi offering sharply different accounts of why a bilateral agreement remains elusive.\n\nUS Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick claimed Thursday that a trade deal collapsed because Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi failed to personally telephone President Donald Trump to finalize the agreement. Speaking on the All-In Podcast, Lutnick said India was given \"three Fridays\" to seal the deal but proved \"uncomfortable\" arranging the call[1][2][3][4]. \"I said \u2014 You need to have Modi; it's all arranged. Modi must call the president. Yet, they were hesitant to do it,\" Lutnick said. \"Consequently, Modi did not make the call\"[1].\n\nIndia swiftly rejected the characterization. Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters Friday that the two leaders spoke eight times during 2025 and that both nations have been \"close to a deal\" on multiple occasions[1][5][6]. \"The characterization of these discussions in the reported remarks is not accurate,\" Jaiswal said, adding that India remains \"interested in a mutually beneficial trade deal\"[7][2][6].\n\nThe White House has not responded to Lutnick's comments[3][8].",

The compact $20 million spacecraft will observe at least 20 known exoplanets during its one-year mission, searching for water vapor and other potential biosignatures by separating planetary signals from the interfering light of their host stars[1][2].\n\n\"Pandora's goal is to disentangle the atmospheric signals of planets and stars using visible and near-infrared light,\" said Elisa Quintana, Pandora's principal investigator at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center[2]. The mission will perform 10 observations of each target planet, with continuous 24-hour monitoring sessions designed to track how stellar surface features impact measurements[2].",

      "description": "Astronomers have captured one of the most powerful cosmic explosions ever observed, an event that released energy equivalent to 400 billion suns as a black hole tore apart and devoured a massive star. The discovery, presented this week at the American Astronomical Society conference in Phoenix, provides unprecedented insight into how black holes feed and the extreme physics governing these violent encounters[1][2][3][4].\n\nThe event, officially designated AT2024wpp and nicknamed \"the Whippet,\" was first detected on September 25, 2024, by the Zwicky Transient Facility at Palomar Observatory in California[5][6]. Located approximately 1.1 billion light-years from Earth, it represents the brightest example to date of a Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient, a rare class of cosmic explosion that scientists are still working to understand[2][7][5].\n\n\"We discovered what we think is a black hole merging with a massive companion star, shredding it into a disk that feeds the black hole,\" said Daniel Perley, the study's lead author from Liverpool John Moores University, at the conference[1][2][3]. \"This was many times more energetic than any similar event and more than any known explosion powered by the collapse of a star.\"",

Despite the cancellation, Trump emphasized that \"all ships will stay in place for safety and security purposes\"[1][2].\n\nThe announcement came one day after Venezuela began releasing a significant number of political detainees, including prominent opposition figures Enrique M\u00e1rquez, a former presidential candidate, and Biagio Pilieri, as well as security analyst Roc\u00edo San Miguel and five Spanish nationals[3][4][5]. The releases represent the first signs of cooperation since U.S. forces captured President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in a special operations raid on January 3[6][7][8].",

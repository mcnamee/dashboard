      "description": "The global solar energy sector faces a potential waste crisis as experts warn that panels installed during the renewable energy surge of the 2000s and 2010s are reaching the end of their lifespan, with current designs making repair and recycling nearly impossible.\n\nAccording to new analysis published this week by Rabia Charef, Senior Research Associate in Circular Economy and Digitalisation at Lancaster University, the world could face up to 250 million tonnes of solar panel waste by 2050 if the industry fails to adopt new design practices[1][2][3]. The panels that powered the clean energy transition were built to withstand decades of harsh weather but were never designed to be repaired, refurbished, or disassembled.",

      "description": "Meta Platforms has begun notifying more than 1,000 employees in its Reality Labs division of layoffs, marking a decisive retreat from the virtual reality and metaverse ambitions that once defined the company's future. The cuts, announced Tuesday morning, represent roughly 10% of the 15,000-person division and will disproportionately impact teams working on VR headsets and Horizon Worlds, Meta's VR-based social network[1][2][3].\n\nChief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth informed affected employees via an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg, with resources being redirected toward AI-powered wearables and smartphone features[2][4]. The move signals an acknowledgment that Meta's costly metaverse vision\u2014which prompted CEO Mark Zuckerberg to rename the company from Facebook in 2021\u2014has failed to gain mainstream traction.",

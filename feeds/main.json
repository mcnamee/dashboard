In an interview with Politico, Trump said \"it's time to look for new leadership in Iran,\" calling the 86-year-old supreme leader \"a sick man who should run his country properly and stop killing people\". Trump added that Iran under Khamenei's rule was \"the worst place to live anywhere in the world because of poor leadership\".[3]",

      "description": "The artificial intelligence revolution is reshaping the global energy landscape, with tech giants racing to secure nuclear power contracts as data center electricity consumption threatens to strain power grids worldwide.\n\nGlobal electricity demand is expected to increase by more than 10,000 terawatt-hours by 2035, a figure equivalent to the total consumption of all advanced economies today, according to a UN report released this week. The International Energy Agency estimates that data center electricity demand grew by more than 75 percent between 2023 and 2024, and the sector is expected to account for over 20 percent of electricity-demand growth in advanced economies by 2030.[1][2][3]",

      "description": "At least six people have died as demonstrations over Iran's collapsing economy spread from Tehran to rural provinces, marking the deadliest unrest since the country's 2022 protest movement. The fatalities, which occurred between Wednesday night and Thursday evening, signal an escalation in tensions between Iranian authorities and protesters demanding relief from runaway inflation and currency depreciation[1][2][3][4].\n\nIranian authorities confirmed that a 21-year-old member of the Basij paramilitary force was killed late Wednesday in Kuhdasht, a city in western Lorestan province, with officials claiming he died \"defending public order\" as 13 other security personnel sustained injuries[3][5][6]. On Thursday, the semi-official Fars news agency reported five additional deaths across Lorestan and Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari provinces, including two people killed in Lordegan and three in Azna during clashes with security forces[3][7][8].\n\nThe protests erupted Sunday after shopkeepers in Tehran's historic Grand Bazaar shuttered their businesses in response to the rial plunging to approximately 1.45 million per U.S. dollar, down from 820,000 rials just one year ago[9][10][11]. According to Iran's Statistical Center, annual inflation reached 42.2 percent in December, with food prices soaring 72 percent year-over-year[9][12]. The demonstrations have since expanded to multiple cities including Isfahan, Shiraz, Mashhad, Hamadan, and Zanjan, with students joining merchants in the streets[13][10][14].",

The achievement, detailed in recent research, represents the first experimental verification of a theorized \"density-free regime\" predicted by plasma-wall self-organization theory[1][3].\n\nThe research, co-led by Prof. Zhu Ping from Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Associate Prof. Yan Ning from the Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, addresses a fundamental challenge in fusion energy development[1][2][3].

The Saturn-sized world, designated KMT-2024-BLG-0792, represents a breakthrough in understanding these enigmatic objects that drift through the galaxy without a parent star[1][2].\n\nThe international research team, led by Subo Dong of Peking University, published their findings in the journal Science on January 1[3][1][4]. By observing a brief microlensing event simultaneously from Earth's surface and the European Space Agency's Gaia space telescope, they determined the planet has a mass roughly 0.7 times that of Saturn\u2014or about 22 percent of Jupiter's mass\u2014and lies approximately 10,000 light-years from Earth[3][1][5][6].\n\n\"What's really great about this work, and really noteworthy, is that it's the first time we've got a mass for these objects,\" said Gavin Coleman, a postdoctoral researcher at Queen Mary University of London who authored a related commentary in Science[4]. Previous detections of rogue planets could only estimate masses indirectly, leaving much about these solitary worlds speculative[3].",

The unrest represents the largest wave of protests in Iran since 2022, when the death of Mahsa Amini sparked nationwide demonstrations[1][2][3].\n\nSemi-official media and rights groups reported multiple fatalities in at least three provinces. Fars news agency said two people were killed in Lordegan, a city in western Iran, during clashes between security services and protesters[5][6][7]. The human rights organization Hengaw corroborated deaths in Lordegan, saying security forces opened fire on demonstrators[8][5][9]. Another death was reported in Isfahan province in central Iran[5][6][7].\n\nAuthorities confirmed one person killed in Kuhdasht, a western city, though accounts of the incident diverged sharply. State media identified the deceased as Amirhossam Khodayari Fard, a 21-year-old member of the Basij paramilitary unit[2][5][10][7]. The Revolutionary Guards said 13 other militia members were wounded and accused demonstrators of \"taking advantage of the atmosphere of popular protests\"[7][5]. However, Hengaw said Khodayari Fard was a protester killed by security forces[5][6][7]. Reuters could not independently verify the reports[7][4].",

Recent observations have pinpointed its origin to the direction of Sagittarius, a corridor leading to the galaxy's turbulent core roughly 26,000 light-years away[2][3][5].\n\n\"It has been approaching from the general direction of the constellation Sagittarius, which is where the central region of our galaxy, the Milky Way, is located,\" NASA confirmed[5]. The object's trajectory and hyperbolic excess velocity of approximately 58 kilometers per second suggest it was ejected from a high-energy environment marked by intense radiation and dense stellar traffic[1][2][3].",

The Italian foreign ministry, citing Swiss police, estimated around 40 fatalities[4][8][9]. More than 100 people were inside the bar when the fire broke out, witnesses and officials said[2][5][6].",

The finding was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday[4][5].\n\nRussia claimed on Monday that Ukraine launched 91 long-range attack drones at Putin's Valdai residence in the Novgorod region, calling it a \"terrorist attack\"[6][7][8]. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said all drones were intercepted and warned Moscow would revise its negotiating position[7][9][8]. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy swiftly dismissed the allegations as \"another lie\" intended to sabotage diplomatic progress[9][10].",

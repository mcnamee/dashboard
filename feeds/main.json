The research, published on January 12 in the journal Ecological and Evolutionary Physiology, is the first to assess how natural heat waves affect honey bee colonies' capacity to regulate temperature and maintain healthy populations.[1][2]\n\nThe findings arrive as commercial beekeepers across North America already face colony losses potentially reaching 60 to 70 percent in recent years, according to Washington State University entomologists, underscoring the urgency of understanding how climate change compounds existing threats to these critical pollinators.[3]",

      "description": "A series of discoveries announced this week are reshaping astronomers' understanding of the early universe, revealing unexpected heat, unusual galaxy types, and cosmic structures that defy existing models of how the first galaxies formed and evolved.\n\nResearch published January 12 in Nature Astronomy describes a massive galaxy that \"lived fast and died young\" after its supermassive black hole slowly starved it of the cold gas needed to form new stars. Meanwhile, separate findings presented at the 247th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Phoenix show galaxy clusters far hotter than predicted and objects so strange that scientists are comparing them to the platypus.[1][2][3]",

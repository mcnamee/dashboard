The remarks came shortly after a near-collision between a Starlink satellite and a newly launched Chinese spacecraft on December 12[3][4].\n\nChina cited several incidents to support its concerns, including two occasions in 2021 when Starlink satellites came alarmingly close to China's space station, forcing astronauts to conduct evasive maneuvers[2][5]. More recently, a Starlink satellite disintegrated on December 17, producing over 100 debris fragments[2][6]. \"For spacecraft operated by developing countries lacking orbit-control capability, space situational awareness, or adequate reaction time, this undoubtedly poses a significant threat,\" the representative stated[2].",

The closure came amid a broader confrontation over control of Yemen's resource-rich eastern provinces, where Saudi-backed forces launched military operations on Friday that killed at least seven people[4][5][6].\n\nAir traffic at the airport\u2014Yemen's main international gateway outside Houthi control\u2014was halted after Yemen's internationally recognized government, backed by Riyadh, imposed new restrictions on flights to and from the UAE[1][2]. Rather than comply, Yemen's transport minister, aligned with the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council, ordered a complete shutdown[1][2]. Passengers crowded the terminal awaiting updates, with some traveling for urgent medical treatment left in limbo[7][8].\n\nThe aviation dispute reflects a wider rift that has fractured the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. On Friday, Saudi warplanes conducted seven airstrikes on an STC military camp in Hadramout province's Al-Khasah area, killing at least seven and wounding more than 20, according to STC officials[4][5][6]. The strikes came as Saudi-backed forces launched what they termed a \"peaceful operation\" to retake positions seized by the STC during its December offensive[9][10].",

The research, published in The Astrophysical Journal and announced this week, uses these stellar runaways as tracers to probe the galaxy's invisible structure[1][2][3][4].\n\nThe team, led by Haozhu Fu of Peking University, focused on RR Lyrae stars, ancient pulsating giants that serve as reliable distance indicators due to their predictable brightness patterns[1][3]. By analyzing data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Chinese LAMOST telescope, and the European Space Agency's Gaia satellite, researchers sifted through more than 135,000 candidate stars before identifying the most reliable hypervelocity examples[1][3].\n\nSeven of the discovered stars are moving at tangential velocities exceeding 800 kilometers per second\u2014well above the roughly 550 km/s needed to break free from the Milky Way at the sun's position[1][3][5]. According to Phys.org, all 87 stars exceed the galaxy's escape velocity in their tangential component, suggesting many will eventually drift into intergalactic space[1][2].",

The team coupled nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond\u2014tiny atomic defects containing electron spins\u2014to a microwave cavity, where they observed an unexpected phenomenon: after an initial burst of energy, the system produced a sustained train of coherent microwave pulses lasting up to a millisecond[2][4].\n\n\"What's remarkable is that the seemingly messy interactions between spins actually fuel the emission,\" said Dr. Wenzel Kersten, first author of the study, in a press statement. \"The system organizes itself, producing an extremely coherent microwave signal from the very disorder that usually destroys it\"[1][3].",

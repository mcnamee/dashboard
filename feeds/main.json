Yet the specifics of this arrangement remain unclear to its most important stakeholder: Greenland itself.[1][2]",

The decision provided a stabilizing force for markets still recovering from a historic bond selloff earlier in the week triggered by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's snap election announcement.\n\nAsian equities edged higher following the decision, with Japan's Nikkei 225 rising 0.2% to 53,800.28. U.S. futures also gained modestly, with S&P 500 futures up 0.2%. South Korea's Kospi climbed 0.6%, trading just below the 5,000 milestone it crossed for the first time on Thursday.[1][2][3][4]",

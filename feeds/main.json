The announcement comes after months of pressure from Trump, who in July sent letters to 17 pharmaceutical CEOs demanding they slash U.S. drug prices to match those overseas or face tariffs and other penalties[4][5].",

      "description": "President Donald Trump's plan to break up the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder has stalled a major government funding package, as Colorado's senators demanded protections for the climate research hub they say is under retaliatory attack.\n\nDemocratic Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper placed a hold on a five-bill Senate appropriations package late Thursday, blocking progress on spending legislation just days before Congress began its year-end recess[1][2]. The move came three days after White House budget director Russell Vought announced the administration would dismantle NCAR, calling it \"one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country\"[3][4].\n\n\"President Trump is attacking Colorado because we refuse to bend to his corrupt administration,\" the senators said in a joint statement[1]. \"We are holding the Senate's appropriations package to demand full funding for NCAR.\"\n\nThe standoff left lawmakers scrambling as they face a January 30 funding deadline[2]. Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins told reporters Thursday evening that only one hold remained on the package after weeks of negotiations with fiscal conservatives, identifying the Colorado senators as the final obstacle[2][5].",

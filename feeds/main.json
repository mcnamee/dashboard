      "description": "Researchers from the University of Hong Kong and Xidian University have introduced a framework to transform satellites into dual-function communication centers and computing servers for the next generation of mobile networks. The approach, called space-ground fluid AI, aims to deliver artificial intelligence services globally as the race toward sixth-generation networks accelerates ahead of expected commercialization in 2030[1][2].\n\nThe research, published in the journal Engineering on December 22, addresses a fundamental challenge in extending AI capabilities beyond terrestrial networks[1][2]. According to the International Telecommunication Union, 6G will introduce new usage scenarios including \"integrated artificial intelligence and communication\" and \"ubiquitous connectivity\"[1][2]. However, ensuring continuous AI services in remote and underserved areas remains difficult with ground-based infrastructure alone.\n\nThe space-ground fluid AI framework draws its name from water's ability to flow seamlessly across boundaries. AI model parameters and data features move continuously between satellites and ground stations, adapting to the ever-changing network topology created by satellite mobility[2][3]. Professor Kaibin Huang, a key researcher on the project, noted the framework leverages satellites' predictable trajectories to enable fluid horizontal and vertical task migration across networks[4][3].",

When the string is released, the structure returns to its compact, flat configuration, allowing for repeated use without damage or reassembly[1][4][5].\n\n\"The simplicity of the whole actuation mechanism is a real benefit of our approach,\" said Akib Zaman, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student at MIT and lead author of the research paper[1][5]. \"The user just needs to provide their intended design, and then our method optimizes it in such a way that it holds the shape after just one pull on the string.\"",

The rocket's first stage performed normally, but telemetry data showed hydrogen tank pressure in the second stage began dropping during the first stage burn, JAXA executive Masashi Okada told reporters[1][2]. Whether the satellite separated from the rocket or where it ended up remains unknown[1][2].\n\nHours later, South Korean company Innospace's Hanbit-Nano rocket lifted off from Brazil's Alcantara Space Center at 10:13 p.m. local time but crashed approximately 30 seconds after liftoff[3][5][6][7]. The vehicle initially followed its planned vertical trajectory before an anomaly caused it to fall to the ground within a pre-designated safety zone, with no reported casualties[5][7][8]. The rocket was carrying eight payloads, including five satellites for undisclosed customers from Brazil and India[3][5][9].",

      "description": "The James Webb Space Telescope has detected UV-fluorescent carbon monoxide in the debris disk of a young star for the first time, providing evidence that crashing exocomets continuously replenish gas in planetary systems and may influence the composition of forming planets.\n\nAstronomers discovered the warm CO gas within the terrestrial planet zone of HD 131488, a 15 million-year-old star located approximately 500 light-years away in the Centaurus constellation, according to research published on arXiv in December 2025[1][2]. The observations, made in February 2023 using JWST's NIRSpec instrument, revealed gas spread between 0.5 and 10 astronomical units from the star\u2014the region where Earth-like planets typically form[3][2].\n\n\"The discovery of warm, fluorescent gas in a debris disk is the first such detection ever made,\" wrote lead author Cicero Lu of the Gemini Observatory and colleagues in the paper[1][2]. The team found the gas exhibited a vibrational temperature of 8,800 Kelvin while its rotational temperature reached only 450 Kelvin near the star, indicating the molecules were out of thermal equilibrium and excited by ultraviolet radiation[3][2].",

The military emphasized that \"every meter of the city came at a high cost\" for Russian forces and that Ukrainian defenders \"wore down the enemy\" during the prolonged battle[1][5][6].\n\nDespite the withdrawal, Ukrainian officials maintain the city remains under their fire control. \"The occupiers present in the city are being engaged, their logistics are being cut off. Enemy units are being blocked to prevent further advancement,\" the General Staff stated[7][4]. Ukraine's Defense Forces continue conducting combat missions in the Sloviansk direction while working to reduce Russian offensive potential[5][6].",

      "description": "Computational astrophysicists have achieved a major milestone in black hole research, creating the most realistic simulations of how matter falls into black holes while emitting intense radiation, according to a study published this week in The Astrophysical Journal. The work coincides with recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope showing evidence of \"monster stars\" that may explain how supermassive black holes formed in the early universe.\n\nThe simulation breakthrough, led by Lizhong Zhang from the Institute for Advanced Study and the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Astrophysics, represents the first time scientists have modeled black hole accretion in full general relativity without using simplifying approximations[1][2][3][4]. Using two of the world's most powerful supercomputers \u2014 Frontier at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Aurora at Argonne National Laboratory \u2014 the team tracked how matter spirals into stellar mass black holes, forming turbulent disks, launching powerful winds, and sometimes producing jets[2][3].\n\n\"This is the first time we've been able to see what happens when the most important physical processes in black hole accretion are included accurately,\" Zhang said[1][2][3]. The simulated light spectra closely matched observations from real systems, from ultraluminous X-ray sources to X-ray binaries, providing confidence in the model's accuracy[2][3].",

The Freya Hydrate Mounds, published this week in Nature Communications, extend the known depth limit for such formations by nearly 1,800 meters[1][2][3][4].\n\nThe discovery was made during the Ocean Census Arctic Deep\u2013EXTREME24 expedition in May 2024 on the Molloy Ridge, using the remotely operated vehicle Aurora to explore the seafloor beneath massive methane gas plumes[2][3][4]. Scientists from UiT - The Arctic University of Norway led the expedition, documenting three hydrate mounds, collapse features, and dense communities of chemosynthetic organisms that survive without sunlight[1][5][2].\n\n\"This discovery rewrites the playbook for Arctic deep-sea ecosystems and carbon cycling,\" said Giuliana Panieri, professor at UiT and Chief Scientist of the expedition. \"We found an ultra-deep system that is both geologically dynamic and biologically rich, with implications for biodiversity, climate processes, and future stewardship of the High North\"[2][3].",

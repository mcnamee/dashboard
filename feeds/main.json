      "description": "Global stock markets are riding high on artificial intelligence euphoria at the start of 2026, but investors may be overlooking a significant threat: a surge in inflation driven partly by the technology investment boom, coupled with mounting power constraints that could derail ambitious AI buildout plans[1].\n\nTech giants including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon are projected to spend more than $400 billion combined in 2026 on AI infrastructure, up from approximately $380 billion in 2025[2][3][4]. Alphabet disclosed in its third-quarter 2025 earnings that capital expenditures for 2025 would reach around $85 billion, with expectations of further increases in 2026[5][6]. Microsoft spent $34.9 billion on capital expenditures in the first quarter of its fiscal 2026, with half allocated to short-lived assets like GPUs and CPUs[5][4].\n\nYet this spending spree is raising concerns among fund managers about inflation pressures that could force central banks to halt interest rate cuts. \"You need a pin to burst the bubble, and it will likely come through tighter monetary conditions,\" said Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset at Royal London Asset Management[7][1]. Morgan Stanley strategist Andrew Sheets projects U.S. consumer price inflation will remain above the Federal Reserve's 2% target until late 2027, partly due to substantial corporate investments in AI[7][1].",

      "description": "Jupiter's moon Europa remains one of the most tantalizing targets in the search for extraterrestrial life, but two recent studies paint a complex and sometimes contradictory picture of whether its vast subsurface ocean could actually support living organisms.\n\nNASA announced on Sunday that data from the Juno spacecraft has provided the first direct measurement of Europa's ice shell thickness, determining it averages about 18 miles (29 kilometers) in the region observed during a 2022 flyby. The findings, published in Nature Astronomy in December, represent a landmark measurement that settles a long-standing scientific debate over whether the shell is thin or thick.[1][2][3]\n\n\"The 18-mile estimate relates to the cold, rigid, conductive outer-layer of a pure water ice shell,\" said Steve Levin, Juno project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"If an inner, slightly warmer convective layer also exists, which is possible, the total ice shell thickness would be even greater.\"[2][3]",

The electric vehicle maker is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2025 earnings on Wednesday, January 28, amid mounting evidence that CEO Elon Musk's political activities and the company's aging vehicle lineup are weighing heavily on business performance.\n\nAccording to Brand Finance, Tesla's brand value fell by $15.4 billion, or 36%, in 2025, marking its third consecutive annual decline. The London-based research firm now values the Tesla brand at $27.61 billion, down from $43 billion at the start of 2025 and well below its peak of $66.2 billion in January 2023.[1][2][3]",

      "description": "Prime Minister Mark Carney told President Donald Trump that Canada stands by its trade diversification strategy and recent deal with China during a phone call Monday, pushing back against claims from the Trump administration that he had backed down from his earlier criticism of American trade policy.\n\n\"I meant what I said in Davos,\" Carney told reporters Tuesday before a cabinet meeting in Ottawa. \"Canada was the first country to understand the change in U.S. trade policy that he had initiated, and we're responding to that.\"[1][2]\n\nThe call comes amid escalating tensions between Washington and Ottawa as the two countries prepare for a formal review of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement later this year. Trump had threatened over the weekend to impose 100% tariffs on Canadian goods if Canada proceeds with a trade agreement with China, posting on Truth Social that Prime Minister Carney was \"gravely mistaken\" if he thought Canada could become a \"Drop Off Port\" for Chinese products.[3][4]",

The four-second move from 89 seconds, set in January 2025, reflects what scientists say are intensifying nuclear threats, accelerating climate change, and the growing risks posed by artificial intelligence.\n\n\"The Doomsday Clock's message cannot be clearer,\" Alexandra Bell, president and CEO of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, said at the announcement. \"Catastrophic destruction, primarily due to nuclear risks and other global threats,\" is becoming increasingly probable, according to the organization.[1][2]",

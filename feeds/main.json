      "description": "Hours after US forces captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in an overnight military strike, the streets of Caracas remained largely deserted Saturday as residents grappled with an uncertain future and Venezuelan officials demanded proof their leader was still alive.\n\nThe capital awoke to desolate streets patrolled by security forces following explosions that began around 2 a.m. local time[1][2]. Parts of southern Caracas remained without electricity after strikes targeted the Fuerte Tiuna military base and La Carlota airbase[2][3], while smoke continued billowing from the Port of La Guaira to the north[1][4]. Downtown Caracas smelled of gunpowder, according to CNN reporters[5].\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, had been \"captured and flown out of the country\" following what he called a \"large-scale strike\"[6][7]. The operation, which Trump said was conducted with US law enforcement, marked the first such American military intervention in Latin America since the 1989 Panama invasion that ousted Manuel Noriega[1][3].",

If they leaked...I think maybe it would have been a very different result.\"\n\nThe administration's decision not to brief the so-called \"Gang of Eight\"\u2014the top congressional leaders and chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate intelligence committees\u2014before the operation has sparked sharp criticism from Democrats and some Republicans who argue it violated the War Powers Act[4][5][6]. The 1973 law requires the president to consult with Congress \"in every possible instance\" before introducing forces into hostilities or situations where imminent hostilities are likely[3].",

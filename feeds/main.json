The assessment came as Trump signaled a potential pause in his escalating threats against Tehran, saying Wednesday he had been informed that killings of protesters had stopped.\n\nThe president has communicated to his advisers that he wants any military action to be \"swift and decisive\" and deliver a \"definitive\" blow to the regime, according to NBC News. However, officials said his team has been unable to guarantee that outcome, with concerns mounting that the United States may lack sufficient military assets in the region to defend against what is expected to be an aggressive Iranian response.[1][2]",

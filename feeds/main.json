According to Reuters, he welcomed the resumption of discussions on a ceasefire[2][3], offering a glimmer of hope as the conflict entered its 15th day.\n\nThe announcement came as foreign ministers from ASEAN's 11 member states gathered in Malaysia's capital for emergency talks aimed at salvaging a peace agreement that collapsed in November[4][5]. Monday's session marked the first face-to-face meeting between Thai and Cambodian government representatives since fighting resumed December 8 along their disputed 817-kilometer border[6][7].",

      "description": "Astronomers have captured one of the most powerful cosmic explosions ever observed, an event that released energy equivalent to 400 billion suns as a black hole tore apart and devoured a massive star. The discovery, presented this week at the American Astronomical Society conference in Phoenix, provides unprecedented insight into how black holes feed and the extreme physics governing these violent encounters[1][2][3][4].\n\nThe event, officially designated AT2024wpp and nicknamed \"the Whippet,\" was first detected on September 25, 2024, by the Zwicky Transient Facility at Palomar Observatory in California[5][6]. Located approximately 1.1 billion light-years from Earth, it represents the brightest example to date of a Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient, a rare class of cosmic explosion that scientists are still working to understand[2][7][5].\n\n\"We discovered what we think is a black hole merging with a massive companion star, shredding it into a disk that feeds the black hole,\" said Daniel Perley, the study's lead author from Liverpool John Moores University, at the conference[1][2][3]. \"This was many times more energetic than any similar event and more than any known explosion powered by the collapse of a star.\"",

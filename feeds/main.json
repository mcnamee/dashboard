The delegation is expected to arrive late Wednesday or early Thursday for meetings with Trump administration officials in the coming days.[1][2][3]\n\nThe trip comes after Taiwan's Office of Trade Negotiations announced Tuesday that the two sides had reached a \"broad consensus\" on trade matters and were scheduling a final wrap-up meeting. If finalized, the agreement could be announced this month, according to The New York Times.[4][5][6][7][8]",

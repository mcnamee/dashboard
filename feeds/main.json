      "description": "Yemen's Aden International Airport shut down on Thursday as escalating tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates spilled into civil aviation, stranding hundreds of passengers and underscoring a deepening crisis between the Gulf powers[1][2][3]. The closure came amid a broader confrontation over control of Yemen's resource-rich eastern provinces, where Saudi-backed forces launched military operations on Friday that killed at least seven people[4][5][6].\n\nAir traffic at the airport\u2014Yemen's main international gateway outside Houthi control\u2014was halted after Yemen's internationally recognized government, backed by Riyadh, imposed new restrictions on flights to and from the UAE[1][2]. Rather than comply, Yemen's transport minister, aligned with the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council, ordered a complete shutdown[1][2]. Passengers crowded the terminal awaiting updates, with some traveling for urgent medical treatment left in limbo[7][8].\n\nThe aviation dispute reflects a wider rift that has fractured the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. On Friday, Saudi warplanes conducted seven airstrikes on an STC military camp in Hadramout province's Al-Khasah area, killing at least seven and wounding more than 20, according to STC officials[4][5][6]. The strikes came as Saudi-backed forces launched what they termed a \"peaceful operation\" to retake positions seized by the STC during its December offensive[9][10].",

      "description": "Astronomers from China have identified 87 hypervelocity stars racing through the Milky Way fast enough to escape the galaxy's gravitational pull, offering a new method to map the distribution of dark matter across our cosmic home. The research, published in The Astrophysical Journal and announced this week, uses these stellar runaways as tracers to probe the galaxy's invisible structure[1][2][3][4].\n\nThe team, led by Haozhu Fu of Peking University, focused on RR Lyrae stars, ancient pulsating giants that serve as reliable distance indicators due to their predictable brightness patterns[1][3]. By analyzing data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Chinese LAMOST telescope, and the European Space Agency's Gaia satellite, researchers sifted through more than 135,000 candidate stars before identifying the most reliable hypervelocity examples[1][3].\n\nSeven of the discovered stars are moving at tangential velocities exceeding 800 kilometers per second\u2014well above the roughly 550 km/s needed to break free from the Milky Way at the sun's position[1][3][5]. According to Phys.org, all 87 stars exceed the galaxy's escape velocity in their tangential component, suggesting many will eventually drift into intergalactic space[1][2].",

The team coupled nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond\u2014tiny atomic defects containing electron spins\u2014to a microwave cavity, where they observed an unexpected phenomenon: after an initial burst of energy, the system produced a sustained train of coherent microwave pulses lasting up to a millisecond[2][4].\n\n\"What's remarkable is that the seemingly messy interactions between spins actually fuel the emission,\" said Dr. Wenzel Kersten, first author of the study, in a press statement. \"The system organizes itself, producing an extremely coherent microwave signal from the very disorder that usually destroys it\"[1][3].",

Images captured on December 12 and 27 show twin jets of material erupting from the comet's nucleus in a pattern suggesting organized rotation rather than random outgassing[1][3][5][6]. According to International Business Times UK, these jets maintain collimation and coherence over extended periods\u2014a phenomenon not anticipated in most comet models, as traditional comet jets typically become diffuse and disperse rapidly[1][3].",

From a total solar eclipse sweeping across the Arctic to the best Perseids meteor shower in more than a decade, the year ahead brings rare opportunities to witness the cosmos in action.\n\nThe year features 13 full moons, including three supermoons, two major eclipses visible from populated areas, and meteor showers with near-perfect viewing conditions[1][2][3][4][5][6]. Astronomers say 2026 presents one of the most compelling years for celestial observation in recent memory[4].",

      "description": "At least six people have died as demonstrations over Iran's collapsing economy spread from Tehran to rural provinces, marking the deadliest unrest since the country's 2022 protest movement. The fatalities, which occurred between Wednesday night and Thursday evening, signal an escalation in tensions between Iranian authorities and protesters demanding relief from runaway inflation and currency depreciation[1][2][3][4].\n\nIranian authorities confirmed that a 21-year-old member of the Basij paramilitary force was killed late Wednesday in Kuhdasht, a city in western Lorestan province, with officials claiming he died \"defending public order\" as 13 other security personnel sustained injuries[3][5][6]. On Thursday, the semi-official Fars news agency reported five additional deaths across Lorestan and Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari provinces, including two people killed in Lordegan and three in Azna during clashes with security forces[3][7][8].\n\nThe protests erupted Sunday after shopkeepers in Tehran's historic Grand Bazaar shuttered their businesses in response to the rial plunging to approximately 1.45 million per U.S. dollar, down from 820,000 rials just one year ago[9][10][11]. According to Iran's Statistical Center, annual inflation reached 42.2 percent in December, with food prices soaring 72 percent year-over-year[9][12]. The demonstrations have since expanded to multiple cities including Isfahan, Shiraz, Mashhad, Hamadan, and Zanjan, with students joining merchants in the streets[13][10][14].",

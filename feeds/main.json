The findings, published in Nature Astronomy in December, represent a landmark measurement that settles a long-standing scientific debate over whether the shell is thin or thick.[1][2][3]\n\n\"The 18-mile estimate relates to the cold, rigid, conductive outer-layer of a pure water ice shell,\" said Steve Levin, Juno project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"If an inner, slightly warmer convective layer also exists, which is possible, the total ice shell thickness would be even greater.\"[2][3]",

      "description": "Narrow bands of ocean covering just over one-third of the world's seas are responsible for absorbing nearly three-quarters of the carbon dioxide that oceans pull from the atmosphere, according to new research that reshapes scientific understanding of Earth's carbon cycle.\n\nThe study, published in Nature Climate Change, reveals that ocean fronts\u2014turbulent boundaries where different water masses collide\u2014cover 36 percent of the global ocean but account for 72 percent of total oceanic carbon dioxide uptake, absorbing approximately 1.8 billion tons of carbon annually.[1][2][3]\n\n\"This is the first time we've been able to quantify the disproportionate role that ocean fronts play in absorbing atmospheric CO2 on a global scale, and it has major implications for climate modelling,\" said lead author Dr. Kai Yang, who completed the research during his PhD at the University of Tasmania's Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) and is now a postdoctoral researcher at Xiamen University in China.[4][1]",

Trump had threatened military intervention as early as November, warning the U.S. would enter Nigeria \"guns-a-blazing\" if violence against Christians continued[5][6].

Footage released by CCTV showed the vehicle resembling a chassis flashing across the track, leaving a trail of mist in its wake[3].

      "description": "An interstellar comet that swept past Earth last week is exhibiting behavior that challenges conventional understanding of cometary physics, according to new analyses published by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. The object, designated 3I/ATLAS, shed unexpectedly large particles as it traveled through the solar system and displayed a rare wobbling jet structure never before observed in a visitor from another star.\n\nIn an essay published December 25, Loeb examined the comet's unusual \"anti-tail\"\u2014a jet of material pointing toward the Sun rather than away from it\u2014and determined that it contains particles significantly larger than typical comet dust[1]. While standard comet tails are dominated by particles around 0.5 microns in radius, the material in 3I/ATLAS's anti-tail measures between 1 and 100 microns, according to Loeb's analysis[2][1]. This size range is necessary to explain how the particles could travel the observed distance of up to 500,000 kilometers toward the Sun without being immediately stopped by solar radiation pressure[3][4][5].\n\n\"The observed length of the anti-tail produced by 3I/ATLAS can only be maintained by particles that are considerably larger than typical dust particles,\" Loeb wrote, adding that such features are difficult to explain using standard comet physics[2][1].",

      "description": "Thailand and Cambodia resumed military negotiations on Christmas Day as their border conflict entered its 18th day, with the death toll reaching 96 and nearly one million people displaced across both nations. The secretary-level talks, held under observation of an ASEAN monitoring team, represent the first direct military dialogue since hostilities erupted on December 7-8[1][2][3].\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Thursday urged both countries to implement the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords signed in October, reiterating President Donald Trump's desire for peace during a call with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet[1][2][3]. \"Secretary Rubio further reaffirmed that the United States is prepared to facilitate discussions to ensure peace and stability between Cambodia and Thailand,\" the State Department said[1][2].",

      "description": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signaled the country will continue to develop missiles over the next five years during visits to major munitions facilities in late 2025, state media reported on Friday, as the nation prepares for a key party congress that will outline its strategic direction through 2030.\n\nKim emphasized that \"the missile and shell manufacturing sector is crucial for enhancing our war deterrent,\" according to the Korean Central News Agency[1][2][3]. During his inspections of major munitions enterprises in the final quarter of 2025, Kim ratified draft documents aimed at modernizing key munitions factories, which are to be presented at an important party congress anticipated to occur in early 2026[1][2][4].\n\nThe announcement follows Thursday's reveal of Kim overseeing the construction of an 8,700-ton nuclear-powered submarine with his daughter, who is viewed as a potential successor, and the test-firing of long-range surface-to-air missiles[2][5][6]. The submarine project is part of the ruling party's effort to modernize North Korea's navy, one of five key policies the party is pushing to develop the nation's defense capabilities, KCNA said[7][8].",

Lin emphasized that China views its relationship with India \"from a strategic height and a long-term perspective\" and said the boundary question remains strictly bilateral[1][2][7][8]. \"China opposes relevant country's groundless and irresponsible comments,\" he added[1].",

The cancellation leaves Cuba facing deepening fuel shortages and extended blackouts, with the island already producing only half the electricity it needs.[5][1]",

Nearly 41 percent of naturalized tree species\u2014those that have established wild populations outside their native ranges\u2014possess traits like rapid growth and small leaves that make them well-suited to disturbed environments but unable to fulfill the ecological roles of the species they replace.[2][4][1]",

The document states the Board would hold \"all transitional legislative and executive authority, emergency powers, and the administration of justice\" over Gaza.[1][2][3]",

The warning escalates tensions weeks after deadly protests rocked Iran and following last year's US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.\n\n\"Hopefully Iran will quickly 'come to the table' and negotiate a fair and equitable deal \u2014 NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS \u2014 one that is good for all parties,\" Trump wrote in a social media post, according to Reuters. \"Time is running out, it is truly of the essence!\"[1][2]\n\nTrump explicitly referenced the previous US military strikes on Iran, warning that \"the next attack will be far worse\" if Tehran does not comply. The president also noted that a \"huge armada is making its way to Iran with great speed and power\" and would \"fulfill its mission with speed and violence if necessary\".[3][4][5][6]",

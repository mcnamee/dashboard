      "description": "The world's leading chipmakers showcased next-generation processors and AI platforms at CES 2026 this week, marking an industry-wide shift toward \"physical AI\" systems designed to power robots, autonomous vehicles, and smart factories rather than just data centers[1][2][3][4][5].\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang opened CES on Monday with the surprise announcement that the company's Vera Rubin computing platform is already in full production, months ahead of its previously projected late-2026 timeline[3][6][7]. The six-chip system, which includes the Rubin GPU and new Vera CPU, delivers up to five times more AI training power than the current Blackwell architecture while reducing inference token costs by roughly one-tenth, according to Nvidia[3][6][8].\n\nHuang also unveiled Alpamayo, an open-source family of AI models designed specifically for autonomous vehicles[9][10]. The system uses chain-of-thought reasoning to help self-driving cars navigate complex scenarios and explain their decisions. Mercedes-Benz plans to integrate Alpamayo into its upcoming CLA model, set to arrive at U.S. dealerships in the first quarter of 2026[11]",

Government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani announced Monday that approximately 80 million Iranians would receive monthly payments of 10 million rials\u2014about $7\u2014starting January 10, redirecting $10 billion previously allocated for import subsidies[3]",

The search, which included the most sensitive radio observations ever conducted on an interstellar object, ruled out any continuous radio transmitters stronger than approximately 0.1 watts at the comet's location[1][3][4].\n\nThe 100-meter Green Bank Telescope observed 3I/ATLAS on December 18, 2025, one day before its closest approach to Earth[5][1][6]. Initial scans flagged roughly 470,000 candidate signals, but all were eventually traced to human-made radio interference[2][4]. \"In the end, there were no surprises,\" lead researcher Benjamin Jacobson-Bell told Space.com[5]. Similar searches using the Allen Telescope Array, MeerKAT in South Africa, and other facilities worldwide reached the same conclusion[1][6]",

      "description": "The world's largest technology showcase opened its doors in Las Vegas on Monday with a decisive pivot toward \"physical AI\"\u2014systems that move, navigate, and operate in real-world environments rather than just processing data on screens. Chipmakers Nvidia, AMD, and Intel unveiled next-generation processors designed to power this shift, while robot manufacturers demonstrated machines that can finally tackle one of home automation's last frontiers: climbing stairs.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang kicked off the show by announcing the Vera Rubin platform, a next-generation AI superchip architecture now in full production that the company claims offers more than triple the speed of its current Blackwell chips[1][2]. The platform, named after astronomer Vera Rubin, combines six chips into what Nvidia calls \"one AI supercomputer,\" with products expected to roll out from partners in the second half of 2026[2][3].\n\n\"The moment for physical AI has arrived\u2014when machines start to comprehend, reason, and operate in the real world,\" Huang said during his keynote[4]. He also unveiled Alpamayo, an AI model for autonomous vehicles that uses vision-language-action models to handle unfamiliar driving scenarios[2][5]. Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola K\u00e4llenius reported testing the Nvidia-powered system on public roads, driving for more than an hour through heavy traffic, with the vehicles expected to launch in the first quarter of 2026[2].\n\nAMD CEO Lisa Su showcased the company's Ryzen AI 400 series processors for PCs, claiming 1.3 times faster multitasking and 1.7 times quicker content creation compared to competitors[6][7]. The company also detailed its forthcoming MI500 series data center GPUs, asserting they will deliver up to a 1,000-fold enhancement in AI performance compared to the MI300X GPUs[7]. Intel announced its Panther Lake processors, branded as Core Ultra Series 3, featuring up to 180 platform TOPS (trillions of operations per second) for AI acceleration and claiming more than 50% faster CPU and graphics performance versus the previous generation[8]",

The study, published January 5 in Nature Communications, concludes that the moon probably lacks tectonic motion, warm hydrothermal vents, or other underwater geologic activity that would provide energy for potential life forms[1][2]",

      "description": "Israel has published a government tender seeking bids from developers to construct a settlement project near Jerusalem that would effectively divide the West Bank into northern and southern sections, marking the final step before construction begins on the long-frozen initiative.\n\nThe tender, posted on Israel's Land Authority website, calls for proposals to develop 3,401 housing units in the E1 area, an open tract of land east of Jerusalem[1][2][3]. The anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now first reported the tender. Yoni Mizrahi, who runs the group's settlement watch division, said initial work could begin within the month[1][2][4].\n\nThe move follows Israel's final approval of the E1 project in August 2025, when the Higher Planning Council validated plans after rejecting all objections[5][6]. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right politician who oversees settlement policy, has championed the project. \"The Palestinian state is being erased from the table not with slogans but with actions,\" he said when Israel gave final approval to the plan in August[3][7]. \"Every settlement, every neighborhood, every housing unit is another nail in the coffin of this dangerous idea.\"",

The statements, made during a CNN interview, triggered sharp rebukes from European leaders who warned that such action would threaten the NATO alliance and upside decades of post-World War II security cooperation[3][4].\n\n\"Nobody is going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,\" Miller said when pressed repeatedly about whether Washington would rule out military intervention[5][6]. He challenged Denmark's territorial claims, asking \"by what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland?\"[7][2]\n\nThe comments came days after a provocative social media post by Miller's wife, Katie Miller, who shared an image Saturday of Greenland covered in the American flag with the caption \"SOON\"[8][9]. The post followed closely on the heels of a U.S. military operation in Venezuela that captured President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, raising international concerns about the Trump administration's willingness to use force against sovereign nations.",

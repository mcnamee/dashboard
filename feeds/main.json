      "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined a direct White House request for President Isaac Herzog to represent Israel at the inauguration of President Trump's Gaza Board of Peace in Davos, Switzerland, resulting in Israel's notable absence from Thursday's ceremony and exposing tensions between Jerusalem and Washington as Trump's peace initiative advances into its second phase.\n\nThe White House extended invitations to 58 nations to join the Board of Peace, with Netanyahu himself receiving an invitation, according to Axios. However, due to an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court in 2024, Netanyahu could not travel to Switzerland. With Herzog already attending the World Economic Forum, senior U.S. officials twice approached the Prime Minister's Office on Tuesday and Wednesday, proposing that Herzog sit on stage alongside Arab and Muslim leaders and sign the board's charter, according to Israel's Channel 12.[1][2][3][4]",

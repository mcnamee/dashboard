The breakthrough, published in Nature Communications on December 15, challenges traditional metallurgical practices by using iron—typically considered a contaminant—as a crucial strengthening component[1][2][3][4][5].\n\nProfessor Naoki Takata and his team at Nagoya University's Graduate School of Engineering created the alloy series using laser powder bed fusion, a 3D printing technique that rapidly solidifies molten metal. The best-performing variant combines aluminum with iron, manganese, and titanium (Al-Fe-Mn-Ti), achieving tensile strength exceeding 250 MPa at 300°C while maintaining room-temperature ductility of 14-17%[5].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/78efda8f-1bae-47dc-baaa-5660ee1ff0a1.mp3","url":"nagoya-university-unveils-3d-p-XwCeLwiRRwWvf3Y_5xMlIw","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/1fc5d064-efe7-416a-b522-c51e25adbc7f","published_datetime":"2025-12-16T10:48:34.989099","title":"AI chip shortage to drive up phone prices, cut shipments","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.lowyat.net/2025/376233/smartphones-with-4gb-ram-may-become-a-thing-again-in-2026/","name":"Smartphones With 4GB RAM May Become A Thing Again In 2026","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--EeUtXzJ8--/t_limit/https://www.lowyat.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DRAM-mobile-memory-1.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--6XZ54LU3--/t_thumbnail/https://www.lowyat.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DRAM-mobile-memory-1.jpg"},"description":"Global smartphone shipments are expected to fall 2.1% in 2026 as a shortage of memory chips—driven by surging demand from artificial intelligence data centers—pushes costs higher across the industry, according to a report released Tuesday by technology market research firm Counterpoint Research[1][2][3][4][5][6].

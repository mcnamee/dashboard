A congressional report released last month projected that Illinois residents could pay up to $200 more for electricity this year compared to 2024, a 15% jump that amounts to roughly $100 per household[4][5][6]. ComEd customers began seeing an additional $10.60 per month on average in June 2025 following a record-setting capacity auction, with the increase expected to continue through May 2026[7][8].\n\nThe surge in costs stems largely from data centers' massive electricity appetite. Exelon, which serves more than 10 million customers including those in northern Illinois through ComEd, reported in July that 33 gigawatts worth of data center projects are seeking to connect to its system—enough to power all homes in California, New York, and Texas combined[9][10]. ComEd alone has 14 gigawatts of data center projects in its queue, more than double the utility's current maximum capacity[11][12].\n\nAccording to a Synapse Energy Economics analysis, data centers could increase annual electricity requirements in the ComEd region by 30% by 2040, driving residential bills up 8.3% and adding 84 million short tons of carbon dioxide emissions[11][13]. The regional transmission organization PJM Interconnection, which oversees Illinois and 12 other states, attributed a $9.3 billion spike in capacity costs directly to data center load growth[14][15].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/e576ae85-1f22-4400-bef9-06510847fb93.mp3","url":"ai-data-centers-strain-illinoi-iwZTPw0ySfCxpLYhCVskwQ","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/363fe13e-706b-400c-a287-30ab318f8eaa","published_datetime":"2025-12-16T19:18:05.914388","title":"AI expected to drive Wall Street gains through 2026","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/20/ai-capex-spending-fears-spread-to-bond-market-following-tech-jitters.html","name":"AI capex spending fears spread to the bond market following tech jitters","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--ajIjJNHo--/t_limit/https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108211171-1760357398425-gettyimages-2219721474-UK_GLOBAL_SWITCH.jpeg%3Fv%3D1763548437%26w%3D1920%26h%3D1080","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--78PvH9lz--/t_thumbnail/https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108211171-1760357398425-gettyimages-2219721474-UK_GLOBAL_SWITCH.jpeg%3Fv%3D1763548437%26w%3D1920%26h%3D1080"},"description":"Artificial intelligence is poised to cement its position as the cornerstone of investment strategies in 2026, with major Wall Street brokerages forecasting another year of market gains driven by AI advancements, according to projections released Monday.\n\nThe S&P 500 is expected to climb nearly 12% to reach 7,490 by the end of 2026, marking a fourth consecutive year of growth, according to a Reuters survey of leading financial institutions[1][2][3].

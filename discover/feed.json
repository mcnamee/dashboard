Currently, approximately 750 to 1,000 glaciers disappear annually, but that figure is projected to triple or quadruple within two decades[3][4][5].\n\nUnder current climate policies, which put the world on track for 2.7 degrees Celsius of warming above preindustrial levels, around 3,000 glaciers would vanish every year between 2040 and 2060[1][6][2]. If warming reaches 4 degrees Celsius, annual losses could peak at 4,000 glaciers in the mid-2050s—a rate three to five times higher than today[2][1]. Even if warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius as outlined in the Paris Agreement, roughly 2,000 glaciers would still disappear annually by 2041[1][5].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/fbc3d7d7-d547-4e1a-afb7-81782e84691a.mp3","url":"glacier-extinction-to-peak-by-jG_B0M1eTlqlKzSf3u.yxg","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/ce7e434e-e8e9-4631-b7b4-bdd2db920081","published_datetime":"2025-12-15T16:21:37.293100","title":"Russia rejects key proposals as Berlin peace talks continue","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/zelenskyy-offers-to-drop-nato-bid-in-exchange-for-security-guarantees-refuses-to-cede-land","name":"Zelenskyy offers to drop NATO bid in exchange for security guarantees, refuses to cede land","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--FUaQ-8x2--/t_limit/https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/12/2025-12-14T163118Z_1192895138_RC2FGIA877UF_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-GERMANY-1024x683.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--qJB93vBG--/t_thumbnail/https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/12/2025-12-14T163118Z_1192895138_RC2FGIA877UF_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-GERMANY-1024x683.jpg"},"description":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky resumed negotiations in Berlin on Monday with U.S. envoys and European leaders, but prospects for a swift end to the war dimmed as Russia signaled it would reject key elements of any revised peace plan[1][2][3][4].\n\nThe talks, now entering their second day, brought together Zelensky, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law, following a five-hour session on Sunday that Witkoff described as yielding \"a lot of progress\"[1][3][5].

The black hole, designated RBH-1, leaves a 200,000 light-year trail of newborn stars in its wake.\n\n\"It boggles the mind,\" said Pieter van Dokkum of Yale University, who led the discovery team[1][2]. \"The forces that are needed to dislodge such a massive black hole from its home are enormous. And yet, it was predicted that such escapes should occur.\"\n\nVan Dokkum and colleagues first spotted the streak using the Hubble Space Telescope in 2023, but JWST's near-infrared observations provided definitive proof by revealing a supersonic bow shock ahead of the black hole[3][2]. The researchers believe the black hole was ejected when two galaxies merged and their central black holes collided, with gravitational waves from the merger imparting a powerful recoil kick[2][4].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/b0fe447e-b35f-4b4a-b913-795d5cb8d85f.mp3","url":"astronomers-observe-possible-f-MYP2J_IlRwqeYsM2IQMNeQ","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/3882f878-2218-4594-8906-49bee2064071","published_datetime":"2025-12-18T13:10:09.118380","title":"Investors await delayed inflation data as Oracle turmoil rattles tech","featured_image":{"url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-collapsing-stock-shows-ai-100300780.html","name":"Oracle's collapsing stock shows the AI boom is running into two hard limits: physics and debt markets","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--NUXX9o_c--/t_limit/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ghphOf9r4MTsa..WvF2UqA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04NTU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fortune_175/1128bc704aedeb9be255943b0de881e4","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--udgj6PvP--/t_thumbnail/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ghphOf9r4MTsa..WvF2UqA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04NTU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fortune_175/1128bc704aedeb9be255943b0de881e4"},"description":"Investors awaited a delayed US inflation report Thursday amid mounting concerns over tech sector valuations, with Oracle's AI spending spree triggering renewed questions about the sustainability of artificial intelligence investments.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics was scheduled to release November consumer price data at 8:30 AM Eastern Time, a report marked as unusual after a 43-day government shutdown forced the agency to cancel October's figures entirely[1][2].

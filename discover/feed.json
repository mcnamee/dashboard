This translates to nearly 16 inches of total rise over that period[1][2].\n\nChris Piecuch, a physical oceanographer at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who conducted the research, analyzed data from 70 tide gauges distributed along the contiguous U.S. coast[1][2]. \"When you consider all the available observations, the data point in the opposite direction—that U.S. coastal sea level is clearly on an accelerating course,\" he said[2].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/7c900e0c-0cdc-44ee-8e8a-c402fa4f6546.mp3","url":"study-finds-us-sea-level-rise-PkGYnWgeRuitjvzjVwl.Og","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/1529141e-78b1-471a-bce0-716bf6c84184","published_datetime":"2025-12-18T03:25:11.269120","title":"AI systems tackle transformer limits, materials discovery","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/15/1129210/ai-materials-science-discovery-startups-investment/","name":"AI materials discovery now needs to move into the real world","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--3yxz-9U7--/t_limit/https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MIT_AI-Hype_2-5.jpg%3Fresize%3D1200%252C600","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--wwHqrW7N--/t_thumbnail/https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MIT_AI-Hype_2-5.jpg%3Fresize%3D1200%252C600"},"description":"Researchers unveiled two separate breakthroughs this week that leverage large language models to accelerate materials discovery and improve transformer architectures, addressing longstanding limitations in AI systems.\n\nMIT and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab introduced PaTH Attention, a new encoding technique that makes positional information in transformers adaptive and context-aware rather than static, according to a paper presented at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) this month[1][2][3]. The development addresses a key limitation in how large language models track state changes and sequential reasoning over long texts.\n\nMeanwhile, researchers from the Institute of Industrial Science at the University of Tokyo announced MatAgent, an AI framework built around a large language model that guides the search for new inorganic materials using natural language reasoning, according to a study published this month in Cell Reports Physical Science[4][5].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/1529141e-78b1-471a-bce0-716bf6c84184.mp3","url":"llms-advance-materials-discove-DizZBAExTu2zzSveISsjpQ","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/bf0227de-c5df-47ee-a0fa-cc0f1ac3aa33","published_datetime":"2025-12-18T02:48:20.135071","title":"Trump defends record as economic approval hits new low","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/12/17/us/trump-address-nation-speech","name":"Trump to Address Nation Tonight: Live Updates - The New York Times","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--jt1Pn3oD--/t_limit/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/17/multimedia/17trump-speech-promo-915pm-tzpc/17trump-speech-promo-915pm-tzpc-facebookJumbo.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--lsqvX--A--/t_thumbnail/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/17/multimedia/17trump-speech-promo-915pm-tzpc/17trump-speech-promo-915pm-tzpc-facebookJumbo.jpg"},"description":"President Donald Trump defended his administration's record in a prime-time address from the White House on Wednesday, claiming he \"inherited a mess\" from former President Joe Biden while asserting he has brought \"more positive change to Washington than any administration in American history\"[1][2][3].

The comet will make its nearest approach on December 19 at approximately 168 million miles from our planet—posing no threat—before departing the solar system forever[1][2][3].\n\nRecent images captured on December 14 and 15 reveal an anti-tail stretching approximately 500,000 kilometers from the comet's nucleus toward the Sun, surpassing the average Earth-Moon distance of 384,400 kilometers[4][5][6][7]. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb reports this is the largest anti-tail ever observed on any comet[4][5]. To reach this length in the 45 days since the comet's closest approach to the Sun, material would need to travel sunward at least 130 meters per second relative to the nucleus[5][6][8].\n\nLoeb, who has catalogued what he calls 14 anomalies in 3I/ATLAS's behavior, suggests an alternative explanation: \"a jet from a technological thruster\"[4][5]. His latest concern focuses on the comet's rotation axis, which appears aligned within 8 degrees of the Sun's direction—an orientation with roughly a 0.5 percent probability of occurring naturally[9][10][11].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/0412d375-8506-4c99-8d9d-4e57b28101de.mp3","url":"interstellar-comet-3iatlas-nea-XzdqkK4HRVqKHU_9JvLviA","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/d4d85917-cb77-4e94-816c-e0a8ccd6f39d","published_datetime":"2025-12-17T21:25:48.642181","title":"Trump's economic approval hits record low amid inflation concerns","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-approval-rating-slips-39-economy-weighs-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2025-12-16/","name":"Trump's approval rating slips to 39%, economy weighs, Reuters/Ipsos poll finds","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--UgM4rKGV--/t_limit/https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6247YCRLN5LSXNBMVVIN22Y5XY.jpg%3Fauth%3D1c4fecc826275b72c6c673f84714c95d4caf13ae59d2447d8040bdf59e3397f0%26height%3D1005%26width%3D1920%26quality%3D80%26smart%3Dtrue","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--3E8UkY6B--/t_thumbnail/https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6247YCRLN5LSXNBMVVIN22Y5XY.jpg%3Fauth%3D1c4fecc826275b72c6c673f84714c95d4caf13ae59d2447d8040bdf59e3397f0%26height%3D1005%26width%3D1920%26quality%3D80%26smart%3Dtrue"},"description":"President Donald Trump's approval rating on the economy has plummeted to its lowest level across both of his presidential terms, with multiple polls released this week showing Americans increasingly holding him responsible for rising costs and persistent inflation.\n\nAn NPR/PBS News/Marist poll published Tuesday found just 36% of Americans approve of Trump's handling of the economy, the lowest figure recorded by Marist in six years of tracking the issue[1].

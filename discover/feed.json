While the prototype successfully generates EUV light—the key technology for manufacturing advanced chips that power artificial intelligence systems and smartphones—it has not yet produced working chips, according to two people with knowledge of the project[1][2][3].\n\nThe development comes as China pursues what sources described as its own \"Manhattan Project\" for semiconductors, a six-year government initiative to achieve complete independence from Western chip technology[1][2][3]. President Xi Jinping has made semiconductor self-sufficiency a top national priority, with the effort coordinated by his confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission[1][2][3]. Chinese electronics giant Huawei plays a central role in coordinating thousands of engineers across state research institutions and companies nationwide[1][2][3].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/4b384f0a-9130-4dc8-a06d-1cf9716dcf04.mp3","url":"china-unveils-prototype-machin-sm8ACVnkRd2.E62OCP2Sww","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/9ea2b793-9796-4555-90be-ac3ac1565d8c","published_datetime":"2025-12-17T14:14:47.843868","title":"Gene editing sorts mosquitoes by color for disease control","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250724/Gene-edited-mosquitoes-slash-malaria-spread-9325-using-self-propagating-shield.aspx","name":"Gene-edited mosquitoes slash malaria spread 93% using self ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--0CBW-WSP--/t_limit/https://www.news-medical.net/images/news/ImageForNews_815344_17534043794739778.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--0aHWgssj--/t_thumbnail/https://www.news-medical.net/images/news/ImageForNews_815344_17534043794739778.jpg"},"description":"Scientists have developed a gene-editing breakthrough that makes separating male and female mosquitoes as simple as distinguishing dark from pale insects, a development that could transform efforts to control diseases like dengue, Zika and chikungunya[1][2][3].\n\nThe research, published in Nature Communications on December 10, introduces a genetically engineered strain of the Asian tiger mosquito where all males appear dark and all females remain pale yellow[2][1][4].

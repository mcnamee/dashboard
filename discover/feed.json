The team, led by Professor Shinichi Komaba alongside PhD candidate Yuki Fujii and Assistant Professor Zachary T. Gossage, used a technique called the diluted electrode method to precisely measure how quickly ions move through battery materials[1][3][4].\n\n\"Our results quantitatively demonstrate that the charging speed of a sodium-ion battery using a hard carbon anode can attain faster rates than that of a lithium-ion battery,\" Komaba said[1][3].\n\nThe researchers calculated that sodium ions move with apparent diffusion coefficients ranging from 10^-10 to 10^-11 cm²s^-1, faster than lithium's 10^-10 to 10^-12 cm²s^-1[4]. Sodium also requires less activation energy—approximately 55 kJ mol^-1 compared to lithium's 65 kJ mol^-1—making it less sensitive to temperature changes[1][2][3].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/544963f4-2979-4c22-b346-2390fae69249.mp3","url":"sodium-ion-batteries-gain-edge-8NYcaFyFTWSCj57Q62bU5Q","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/6d5de92d-3de0-4c27-8715-1d67336acb81","published_datetime":"2025-12-17T09:58:33.065850","title":"Kushner exits Paramount bid as Netflix defends Warner Bros acquisition","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/jared-kushners-affinity-exits-warner-bros-takeover-battle-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-12-16/","name":"Jared Kushner's Affinity exits Warner Bros takeover battle ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--Jbb4Hh3x--/t_limit/https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KTJ2BN2375M5DHY7YGHTBUNW4M.jpg%3Fauth%3D105f5a9551d7fe5ffcb687eed1247adae8b6cd0d69993fcfed1def3405b2cb26%26width%3D1920%26quality%3D80","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--_pIded1e--/t_thumbnail/https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KTJ2BN2375M5DHY7YGHTBUNW4M.jpg%3Fauth%3D105f5a9551d7fe5ffcb687eed1247adae8b6cd0d69993fcfed1def3405b2cb26%26width%3D1920%26quality%3D80"},"description":"Jared Kushner's private equity firm Affinity Partners withdrew from Paramount's hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros.

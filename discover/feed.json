The team, led by Professor Shinichi Komaba alongside PhD candidate Yuki Fujii and Assistant Professor Zachary T. Gossage, used a technique called the diluted electrode method to precisely measure how quickly ions move through battery materials[1][3][4].\n\n\"Our results quantitatively demonstrate that the charging speed of a sodium-ion battery using a hard carbon anode can attain faster rates than that of a lithium-ion battery,\" Komaba said[1][3].\n\nThe researchers calculated that sodium ions move with apparent diffusion coefficients ranging from 10^-10 to 10^-11 cm²s^-1, faster than lithium's 10^-10 to 10^-12 cm²s^-1[4]. Sodium also requires less activation energy—approximately 55 kJ mol^-1 compared to lithium's 65 kJ mol^-1—making it less sensitive to temperature changes[1][2][3].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/544963f4-2979-4c22-b346-2390fae69249.mp3","url":"sodium-ion-batteries-gain-edge-8NYcaFyFTWSCj57Q62bU5Q","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/6d5de92d-3de0-4c27-8715-1d67336acb81","published_datetime":"2025-12-17T09:58:33.065850","title":"Kushner exits Paramount bid as Netflix defends Warner Bros acquisition","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/jared-kushners-affinity-exits-warner-bros-takeover-battle-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-12-16/","name":"Jared Kushner's Affinity exits Warner Bros takeover battle ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--Jbb4Hh3x--/t_limit/https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KTJ2BN2375M5DHY7YGHTBUNW4M.jpg%3Fauth%3D105f5a9551d7fe5ffcb687eed1247adae8b6cd0d69993fcfed1def3405b2cb26%26width%3D1920%26quality%3D80","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--_pIded1e--/t_thumbnail/https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KTJ2BN2375M5DHY7YGHTBUNW4M.jpg%3Fauth%3D105f5a9551d7fe5ffcb687eed1247adae8b6cd0d69993fcfed1def3405b2cb26%26width%3D1920%26quality%3D80"},"description":"Jared Kushner's private equity firm Affinity Partners withdrew from Paramount's hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros.

A digital reconstruction of a 1.5-million-year-old face and a reclassification of one of the most complete human ancestor fossils suggest greater complexity in early human evolution than previously thought.\n\nOn December 16, an international team led by Dr. Karen Baab, a paleoanthropologist at Midwestern University in Arizona, published a reconstruction of the DAN5 fossil from Gona, Ethiopia, in Nature Communications[1][2][3]. The face, assembled from fragments using micro-CT scans, reveals an unexpectedly primitive appearance despite the fossil being classified as Homo erectus, the first human ancestor species to migrate out of Africa[1][2][3].\n\n\"We already knew that the DAN5 fossil had a small brain, but this new reconstruction shows that the face is also more primitive than classic African Homo erectus of the same antiquity,\" Dr. Baab said[3][4]. The reconstruction took approximately one year and combined a brain case with facial fragments and teeth to create what researchers describe as the most complete fossil human skull from the Horn of Africa for this time period[2][4].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/cb5e2b5c-bd95-4e50-b215-0e7ca7a60427.mp3","url":"scientists-reclassify-little-f-qzNdqzUvTeCYR_9NQBO2GQ","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/162b462a-77df-4f7a-9348-b5604f067dac","published_datetime":"2025-12-17T05:55:16.432226","title":"Japan posts $2B surplus ahead of expected rate hike","featured_image":{"url":"https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20251217/p2g/00m/0bu/016000c","name":"Japan logs 322.3 billion yen trade surplus in November","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--f-F2TR-S--/t_limit/https://cdn.mainichi.jp/vol1/2025/12/17/20251217p2g00m0bu015000p/0c10.jpg","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--jXwAsAiu--/t_thumbnail/https://cdn.mainichi.jp/vol1/2025/12/17/20251217p2g00m0bu015000p/0c10.jpg"},"description":"Japan recorded a 322.3 billion yen ($2.08 billion) trade surplus in November, the Finance Ministry reported Wednesday, far exceeding market expectations and marking the country's first surplus since June[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]. The result comes as the Bank of Japan prepares to raise interest rates this week, with exports rebounding after months of pressure from U.S. tariffs.\n\nExports rose 6.1% year-over-year to 9.7 trillion yen in November, beating economist forecasts of 4.8% and marking the fastest growth since February[1][4][5][6][8][9][10][12]. Shipments to the United States jumped 8.8%, the first increase in eight months, while exports to Western Europe surged 23.6%[4][9][10][12]. The stronger-than-expected export performance was driven by demand for automobiles, semiconductor parts, and medical goods[1][10].\n\nHowever, imports grew just 1.3% to 9.4 trillion yen, well below the 2.5% increase economists had anticipated, reflecting weak domestic demand amid persistent inflation[1][4][5][6][8][11][12]. The November surplus significantly exceeded market forecasts of 71.2 billion yen and reversed a 226.1 billion yen deficit from the prior month[1][6][8][11].","audio_url":"https://discover-audio.perplexity.ai/contexts/162b462a-77df-4f7a-9348-b5604f067dac.mp3","url":"japan-posts-2-billion-trade-su-HgB8p85LRQGjKiw6RUwK1A","partition_name":"partition1"},{"page_content_url":"https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai/discover/pages/v1/en-US/e87a09fa-2468-4a54-9549-f2f7a33e7d90","published_datetime":"2025-12-17T05:47:37.824178","title":"Japanese scientists develop plant-based plastic that dissolves in seawater","featured_image":{"url":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/06/05/japan/science-health/japan-ocean-degradable-plastic-research/","name":"Scientists in Japan develop plastic that quickly dissolves ...","image":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--oYLJV4W---/t_limit/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2025/06/05/473567.JPG","thumbnail":"https://pplx-res.cloudinary.com/image/fetch/s--SDQ_SqLK--/t_thumbnail/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2025/06/05/473567.JPG"},"description":"Researchers in Japan have unveiled a new biodegradable plastic made entirely from plant cellulose that rapidly decomposes in seawater without leaving harmful microplastics behind, marking a potential breakthrough in the fight against ocean pollution.\n\nThe team, led by Takuzo Aida at the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science, published their findings December 16 in the Journal of the American Chemical Society[1][2].

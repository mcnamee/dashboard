Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb reports this is the largest anti-tail ever observed on any comet[4][5]. To reach this length in the 45 days since the comet's closest approach to the Sun, material would need to travel sunward at least 130 meters per second relative to the nucleus[5][6][8].\n\nLoeb, who has catalogued what he calls 14 anomalies in 3I/ATLAS's behavior, suggests an alternative explanation: \"a jet from a technological thruster\"[4][5].
